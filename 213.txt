hi, im looking for help/advice. im 17 and just learned im around 18 weeks pregnant. i always known i don't want kids for a long time and even then i didn't plan on having any myself. i live in a state where abortion is outlawed so ill have to travel. my dad is being incredibly supportive and im thankful but he's already dealing with a lot financially and i work a part time job 4-500$ checks so i can't help nearly as much as needed. im looking for advice on how to get funds together, what to expect, words of advice etc. thank you/nMy boyfriend and I (both under the age of 21) were shocked when we got the positive test results back. For me, it was earth-shattering. I can barely care for myself, much less a child. So, we made a call and set up an appointment for a medicated abortion. The only reason we made that choice was that it was listed as 50 dollars cheaper than the surgical one.
This may be entirely my fault and I'm ready to accept that. Because I didn't think to research or look into what the pill would do to me. And because of that, everything I thought I knew about it was wrong. The appointment lasted a total of 4 hours. Throughout most of that time, no one ever told me or explained to me what my body would go through after taking the pill. But, at the very end, the nurses had me and about 6 or 7 other girls inside a room take a single pill. The doctor then came in and describes the very complicated and detailed instructions on how to take "the rest" of the pills. (I was unaware of there being more than one pill)/nKnowing it¡¯s two changes things, doesn¡¯t it? I¡¯ve had a medicated abortion before and I don¡¯t want to go through this again. Single, first time mom of twins, no friends or family within 10 hours, wtf am I going to do???
Edited to add: I know this is crazy town talk but I want to believe that one of these babies is my first angel baby if that makes sense? I always wanted to believe that the spirit chooses their parents before birth and idk I know it¡¯s crazy I just feel like it¡¯s the same spirit who was always supposed to be my baby. Idfk, I¡¯m going through some shit so let me be crazy/ni recently just went through an abortion, but why is it that when everyone asks me if i¡¯m fine, i just want to cry? when i was going through the abortion i was very emotionally and felt so alone i just wanted to die . now i feel somewhat ok but i don¡¯t feel like myself i feel as if i lost a part of me . i haven¡¯t told anyone about how i felt during the whole abortion process and how i feel now . i just keep telling everyone i¡¯m fine . i honestly feel like i can¡¯t talk to anybody ./nHi I just recently found out I am pregnant I would be just over 8 weeks I have had a MA before & the pain was excruciating
I was just wondering what a SA is like & what the pain it like afterwards ? I¡¯m just really scared & if it¡¯s done under twilight sedation will I remember anything ?/nI just found out I¡¯m 5 weeks pregnant and I¡¯ve decided to not continue with the pregnancy. I live in Toronto, and have an appointment booked for next week, however I¡¯m traveling to Nashville for the weekend and having second thoughts. If I need emergency care and the situation goes awry, what is the current situation with abortion care in Tennessee? I¡¯m thinking of canceling the trip. Thinking worst case, obviously, but what if I have a medical emergency on the trip and I lay there on a hospital table bleeding out if they can detect a heartbeat?? My husband thinks I¡¯m overreacting but the situation seems batshit in the states rn.
I ordered from Aid Access in June, and they arrived without a problem. Now, my boyfriend¡¯s sister got pregnant and she wants to use them. I have no problem giving them to her, I can¡¯t imagine how she feels carrying a baby in the circumstances she¡¯s in. The problem I face now is ordering another emergency pack. In the state I live in abortion is completely banned and you can get into legal trouble if pills are shipped through mail starting August 1st. I¡¯m now terrified to order these even though I may need them if anything were to come up. My boyfriend is going to pay (he offered with no hesitation) but I¡¯m the one receiving them, and I¡¯m scared someone may report me if they know. What should I do?
EDIT: Forgot to add, I have Endometriosis so I cannot use most birth controls. We use what we can but I want the pills to be safe./nI found out I was pregnant at about 7.5 weeks. I panicked and instantly made an appointment at planned parenthood which ended up being an entire week later. This pregnancy has forced me to be bedridden and sick for weeks- missing out on work. We are a two income household and there was no way I could keep up my end of work during/after pregnancy. At my appointment, they confirmed that I was at about 8 weeks 6 days. We set my ACTUAL appointment for next week for the surgical procedure. Cut to next week, I arrive to the clinic and they take me into a room. In the room a nurse takes my vitals and injects an IV into my arm. She gives me anti nausea medicine as well as some form of fluid to smoothen out my blood so the sedatives can flow through smoothly. Through that room I could see other girls my age that have just gone through the procedure. They looked rough. It was a couple moments until the room was prepared where they finally called up my boyfriend to enter in with me. I undressed my bottom half and waited for the doctor to come. This is where I began to cry. Remembering the feelings I felt when I had an IUD inserted in the past. I've had them misinform me about how much pain I would feel and I was beyond afraid that they would do it again. The doctor walks in and gives me a brief overview of what is about to happen and then asks to confirm that I wanted to see the remains once everything is finished (I had asked if I could see it earlier). She gave me a book to look through with pictures so I would know what to expect and I still agreed to see. She had me put my legs up and this is where they hooked up the sedatives to my IV. The next few minutes were blurry. I do not remember them inserting that metal thing. However, I do remember hearing myself cry out. I later found out through my boyfriend that the doctor was talking the whole time, the vacuum was loud, and that HE was crying. All of these things that I simply missed bc all I heard was myself crying. Don't let this scare you. I felt nothing but the contractions of my uterus (bc it was shrinking to a smaller size). No actual sharp pains or poking. I also did not feel any tools. The sedatives did a great job at making this experience not so unpleasant. Looking back on it- I would rate the pain a 5/10 (but soft and natural pain if that makes sense). It was over before I even knew it (5min tops). My pants were magically on me and they were already escorting me to the recovery area. I sat for about 5 min before they called me into another room to show me the remains. What I saw was absolutely heartbreaking but also astonishing. They pointed at the fetus (dismembered) as well as the placenta. But what shocked me the most was the entire rib cage and spine that I saw. Next to it and entire arm. To the right the other arm. My heart shattered. This isn't at all what I would've ever wanted and I cannot believe this had just happened. I knew that I made the right decision though. This child would've had to grow up in the exact same conditions as me simply bc of where I am at in life. I believe that I need time to heal from my own childhood before I'm able to build someone else's. My takeaway from this is this: I personally chose the sedatives bc I am aware that the pain is like no other. These are the same sedatives I was on during my wisdom teeth removal (they confirmed that for me at the clinic). I was completely knocked out when getting my teeth done. THIS time I was half conscious and remember parts of the experience. Although i was crying out in pain- I would still go through this experience a second time with 90% less fear (only if I absolutely had to. Some people think women love to get abortions for fun or something). The alternative is the pill- oftentimes people are misinformed on the actual effects of the abortion pill. It is the equivalence of mini labor (a miscarriage) and you're basically told to just take an ibuprofen every few hours. Not to mention you WILL see the fetus. At the clinic I had to specifically ask them if I can see the fetus. It is an extremely traumatizing experience. I don't have words to describe how much this just took away from me. The idea of being in mini labor vs a five minute procedure crossed my mind a million times and I'm so glad I made the last minute decision to have a surgical procedure done. I was pretty much fine afterwards. I ended up having strong cramping for the rest of the day and the next but that's it (besides bleeding ofc). I hope I helped reassure at least one woman that it'll be okay. I promise. You are not alone. I was also frantically researching everything for weeks to figure out just how painful this would be. Now that I've experienced it I wouldn't fear it nearly as much./nI¡¯m usually very careful especially after the first time. It¡¯s been a year and here I am again. I feel so guilty and it¡¯s being done the day before my bday. So I take one life and celebrate another?
They wanted to do it right on my bday.
I don¡¯t know about anyone else but I¡¯m not good to go the next day. I laid in bed crying for three days.
Any advice or anyone go through this as well?/nI think my 1st post did not go through it so I¡¯m trying again. I had my SA 07/07/22. After that I didn¡¯t have any bleeding. One week after the bleeding started like a really bad period (a lot of cramps). The bleeding spot after some days (I would say around 4, 5 days). Well, between yesterday and today I started to feel light cramps but no bleeding. However I just pee (1:30am) and the pre was normal but when I ¡°cleaned¡±, the toilet paper had some light blood. Idk if I have an IUT but I will try to get it test tomorrow. Someone else shared the same situation? Thoughts?/nThe day of my SA I was given an antibiotic and the depo shot. I regret the depo shot so much. I felt like I needed to say yes to birth control because I felt so irresponsible to be there at all and it seemed the least invasive. I am now covered head to toe in yeast. It¡¯s uncomfortable and itchy and I feel gross. Did anyone else have a similar reaction? I went to the doctor and got medication but I¡¯m worried I¡¯ll be fighting yeast for the next three months until this horrible shit is out of my system./nI'm about 6 weeks pregnant.. I just recently found out about a week ago when I noticed I wasn't getting my period.. unfortunately I'm in a situation where I can't tell any of my family members due to their beliefs or just how they feel about it so I've had to keep it to myself I have no support at all... I've had a miscarriage two actually years ago but I don't know if what I went through then will be similar to doing an at home abortion I'm just asking for a little support or if anyone could tell me some words of encouragement or just tell me everything is going to be okay I've come to terms with it and accepted this is the right thing to do but I'm still freaking out about it ..
Also I got the instructions on how I should take the abortion pill it states I can put in mouth or insert vaginally to prevent the side effects from being full force pretty much I haven't read anything about anyone doing it vaginally if someone who's done that before can tell me what to expect for myself if I do it that way./nHi everyone, I have a few questions in how to assist her in getting an abortion without as few people, especially parents, knowing.
She is planning to get the pill. How soon am I able to get an appointment scheduled for consultation and actually getting the pill?
She is under her parent's insurance. I am planning to put my email and address for everything that needs to be filed as such and anything to be sent, but is there anything else that I can do to avoid anything getting into our parent's hands?
Any other help or ideas that I can do to assist her in doing this as discreetly as possible?
Any thoughts or help is greatly appreciated, thank you!/nI just took the misoprostol, (4 under the tongue 200mcg tablets) and I puked after ~32 minutes. They had already totally dissolved, and I¡¯d washed them down with water¡­. Am in danger of it not working?/nI had my 1st pill on Thursday, Waited for 24 hours, took my 1st round of 4 pills. Waited for 4 hours and took the 2nd round of 4 pills.
I should take 4 more pills after another 4 hours but I felt so much pain I just couldn¡¯t do it.
I thought I read everyone¡¯s saying they took 4 pills and I already took 8 pills plus the 1 for stopping the pregnancy.
I thought it¡¯s enough and didn¡¯t take the 3rd time.
Today (Saturday) I¡¯m still bleeding, like 2nd day of period, soaking half pad in 2 hours.
I only saw 2 half-grape size clots 30 mins after my I took the 1st 4 pills./nI¡¯m 3 hours into my pill abortion and i haven¡¯t passed a blood clot or bled that much, what should i do?/nI made an impulsive decision to take eight Misoprostol pills after finding out that I'm five weeks pregnant. It's been seven hours since I took the final four pills, and it's fairly obvious that it didn't work. I'm having mild cramps and diarrhea, but nothing like the medical abortion that I had in the past. Would it be safe to try again when I can obtain Mifepristone and more Misoprostol?/nI was pregnant for about 6 weeks before I got an abortion. I put on like 15lbs in that short time. At the time I had no idea what was going on but then found out I was pregnant. I had the abortion about a week ago and I just feel awful about my body. Iâ€™m just surprised because my stomach looks huge. It looks like I was four months pregnant. And I thought it would go down after the abortion but it hasnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve started working out again but idk what this is. I normally donâ€™t put weight on in my stomach (usually my thighs), so I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s going to go down in time or if I really need to workout that area to lose the weight. It almost seems like bloating but bloating that wonâ€™t go away. Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else has this and what they did to fix it?/nMid last week I found out I was 6 weeks pregnant and I've been incredibly sick and have been missing out on a lot of work as a result. I'm 21 and my partner 22 and we're just not in a space or time of our life to have a baby, so from ages ago we already discussed what we'd do in a situation like this, and that's what we're doing. It's hard but I don't regret my decision./nHey there looking for advice on my situation.
My girlfriend of 8 years now fiancÃ© of 3 was and is well aware of my beliefs on family planning and my need for involvement in the decision making process.
She was actively taking birth control however she recently after a positive pregnancy test admitted she was recently taking it extremely poorly skipping multiple days and playing catch ./nI ordered from them & received my package quickly but Iâ€™m getting a wave of anxiety before taking the pills because of the strange shape of the misoprostol tablet. Itâ€™s a hexagon shape with a check mark imprint on it, my husband encouraged me to do more research before taking the pills in case of it being fake. Please let me know if you have experience taking these!/nI had an MA around 10 days ago: the procedure seemed to have gone well with minimal pain and the unpleasant passing of the pregnancy.
I've noticed though that while I have now stopped bleeding completely and am content that I've passed everything, there is an awful smell coming from my vagina./npanganay ako (F23) sa apat na magkakapatid. at feeling ko buntis ako. marami pa akong pangarap sa family ko. at nasa plano ko na ang pakikipaghiwalay sa 9yrs. boyfriend ko na hindi naman ako nirespeto nung una pa lang, at nahuli ko na may mga binabyaran syang babae to satisfy his needs. ngayon nabuntis nya ako, at nung una pa lang gusto nya na ako mabuntis sabi ko gusto ko kasal muna pero sya tinatawanan lang ako. ngayon gusto kong ipa-abort ang dinadala ko ng hindi nya nalalaman. wala akong mapagsabihan./nSo I went into aid access trying to see the steps to getting pill and went through the consultation but I didnâ€™t pay any money becuase that was too much right now so I didnâ€™t go any firsther bit now Iâ€™m getting an email saying the pills are going to delivered is this a mistake or a hack? If this is real Iâ€™m so happy but idk/nI took the pill July 23 I experienced all the cramps and bleeding and clots. They told me to wait 3-4 to take a pregnancy test itâ€™s been 5 weeks now I took a test today and itâ€™s still positive 1 dark line a the other is very faint. Did anyone else had to wait a long time until their test came back negative? Please let me know!/nI know there have been a lot of posts about aid access shipping here lately so as of today, I can give an update and maybe help someone else if they come across this post.
I received my email confirmation, with my tracking number, on August 10th. I received a text today, August 22nd, from USPS stating that my package has arrived in the US in New York (this is customs)! From what I can remember, it was about a week last time from that notification to delivery but I will update when it actually arrives. This package is being delivered to a state where abortion is illegal./ni really could use some advice, any advice from someone outside of the situation would be greatly, greatly appreciated. i really can't choose what to do. i met my BD in march 2022. i got pregnant april 2022. i know, dumb. i'm the dumbest of dumb. throughout the first 13 weeks of my pregnancy i (22F) lived with my mom while my boyfriend (33M) lived in miami getting his sh*t together to get us a place closer to my mom's house so i'd have some support throughout the pregnancy. so the first 13 weeks really put a lot of stress on our relationship because we had not seen eachother at all and i was alone the whole time. he finally got the apartment when i was 14 weeks and we moved in together for about a week when i found him snapchatting other girls, flirtaciously while in the same bed as me. so i packed my things and went back to my mom's. abortion had been discussed throughout the whole pregnancy but he begged and pleaded for me not to abort, and that he would promise to always have my back. (lol) at 15 weeks i went to an abortion appointment, paid the $1000 and was about to take the dilators when i asked for a few minutes just so i could think about things before i started the abortion. they kicked me out and refunded about $600. after that, we talked and were gonna work on things. he was in miami at the time, never came back to see me or show me that he wanted this so i just blocked him on everything & told him he's dead to me. he hasn't even been to a single appointment regarding the baby. i guess i just feel extremely dumb and irresponsible and like the most selfish bitch for believing these words this man said to me. i feel like a failure as a mother and a fuck up. i so badly just want to terminate the pregnancy because since i've been pregnant i haven't even felt an ounce of happiness or love (disregarding the baby) and it hurts to know that my baby is feeling all of that too. i really just want to abort it and never even think or speak to that creep ever again. i can't believe he just left me and his baby out for dead with no care in the world. i feel so naive and violated and ugly. i know i could proceed with the pregnancy and be a single mom but i'm just scared and heartbroken. i grew up with no father and it has mentally fucked me all throughout my life, obviously, i chose a 33 year old man and believed every lie he ever told me. i have an abortion in north carolina scheduled for thurs & fri but i'm so indecisive because i want to go back to my old life and forget all of this but feel like a terrible person for putting it off for so long because i was selfish. god please forgive me. any advice please i don't care if it's bashing me i just need someone to talk to :(/nI got an abortion on May 31st. I have not stopped bleeding except for maybe 2 days. I have called planned parenthood and they keep telling me it's normal. I have a negative pregnancy test and I only have to use 2 or 3 panty liners a day. Some day the blood is brown and I think it's going to stop but then the next day it will be bright red. The next day it will be dark red then it will go to brown and start all over again. At this point I don't know what to do because planned parenthood said that it's normal but I don't feel like it's normal. It has become normal in my life now but I dont know what to do.. maybe somebody put a spell on me or something I have no fucking clue. Someone please help me or tell me if you've gone through the same thing. I have also been very irregular with my moods it feels like I am constantly pmsing/nme and my bf had unprotected sex using withdrawal method august 2nd, i started the pill 3 days after that and got my period in the placebo week, also 21 days after the unprotected sex i took a test and was negative, i started the placebo week for this month 3 days ago, and before that i started having brown spots and some cramps, does anyone know what it means? the brown spotting kinda looks like egg white discharge but brown, and also seems to have little blood clots i think(? but i havent had any red blood like my period is usually edit: i donâ€™t think i am pregnant since that one test was negative and i had my wisdom teeth out the week after that negative test under anesthesia and had to take several antibiotics for days, if i was pregnant all those pills wouldâ€™ve killed it lol also the doctor told me that those antibiotics would decrease the effect of bc but i did not had intercourse those weeks, when i did it was with a condom too, idk if the antibiotics couldâ€™ve caused the spotting since it affects bc/nHi does anyone have a link to the abortion lines they give you where you can text and talk to someone/nI found out I was just barely 4 weeks pregnant the other day at the ER. I had an injury and the doctor came in and told me I was pregnant. I made the decision that I want a abortion. I just ordered the pills on abortionrx.com, but I canâ€™t help but think what would happen if I go to the hospital in the future. Would they question if I had the baby?

I had sex with my asshole of an ex (we already have 1 child together, around a month ago-mistake). Iâ€™m in TN and the news was on this morning mentioning how the ban goes into effect Thursday. So I went to CVS and got a test. It was positive. Freaked out. For awhile thought I couldnâ€™t text about it or even type about it on my laptop. Sent my therapist a voice memo ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸?like was losing my mind. Planned parenthood said they couldnâ€™t even make any appts because of ban. They gave me a website. I found a place about 30 minutes away (only one here in TN). They saw me today and then I go back Wednesday for it since you have to wait 48 hours. It was just such an insane day. My eyes are burning from crying so much. Iâ€™m sad for the situation and also sad that I had to rush around like a crazy person to try and get this done before the ban starts. So many things to be sad about. I already have 4 children youngest being 17 months old. Just not in a place where I can have another one. I do love babies and children. But I canâ€™t. My ex knows and was supportive financially. Told me to call him if I need anything (I wonâ€™t be)â€¦Part of whatâ€™s also compounding this pain is the realization that things really are over with my ex and I. I was madly in love with him, he was cheating etc etc. Heâ€™s one of my biggest traumas. But yeah. I shouldnâ€™t have let the sex happen. I basically will only speak to him when coparenting from here on out. So anyway. Just a hell of a day, emotionally. I hope I can safely post here. If I get anything rude Iâ€™ll just delete. If anything itâ€™s nice reading other peopleâ€™s posts and the kind responses./nHave anyone used AbortionRX recently.

We still saw each other at work and gave each other awkward smiles but never talked after that. Two months after we went out I found out I was pregnant. I was only 19 years old and didn't want to have a baby or even carry out the pregnancy so I got an abortion. I didn't tell him because we weren't talking anymore and I was set in my decision. Now its two years later, we don't work together anymore, but we matched again on a dating app and have been talking. We're going out for drinks this week. Should I tell him about the abortion? I always felt bad that I didn't at least let him know but is there any point now?/nI had an abortion a few days ago and I can't seem to not think about it. I did have a choice, but my partner and I would've struggled a lot financially as we're barely getting by right now. And mentally, I don't think I could've been fully ready to survive pregnancy and raise a child.
But I can't take my mind off it and cry everyday. If things were stable, I would have kept it. The pain and heavy bleeding don't help, the random big clots. I have done a couple things with friends, and gone to work but struggled. Only my partner and two friends know, but my friends don't know what to do and live far, aside from telling them, we haven't talked about it. My partner doesn't live with me currently but has been trying to come over and tend to me, I keep crying or snapping at him for small things. I know he's hurting too, and we try to talk about it and I apologize./nhey i took miso on aug 18 passed blood clots up til aug 20 still feeling breast swelling and gas? anyone have the same feelings after their MA/nAfter my second abortion, Iâ€™ve had mostly black blood after taking my hormonal birth control. Itâ€™s been 8 months and itâ€™s still mostly black, I feel like somethings wrong and Iâ€™m honestly scared if I may have ashermanâ€™s or caused scarring in my uterus. Is this normal?/nHi everyone. So I had my SA 11 days ago and decided to have sex with my husband this morning. We used lube and a condom, and I did notice some small discomfort down there, but Iâ€™m not sure if it was due to using a condom (first time we ever have in our 4 year relationship) or if my cervix is still healing. Do you think this was a safe choice? Iâ€™ve been bleeding on and off very lightly but havenâ€™t bled since yesterday afternoon. Iâ€™ve read from different sources say to wait 1 week after to have sex, wait 2 weeks, or that you can whenever you feel ready. I guess Iâ€™m just scared I maybe put myself at risk. How long did you wait to have sex after an SA?/nI am a 18yo female who just found out shes 3 weeks pregnant. I am hoping to take the abortive pill to stop the pregnancy, however, I live in Texas.
Does anybody have ANY advice? I was looking to mail the stuff needed, but would it be stopped by the State? Is mail even the easiest way or is simply going to a clinic better?/nI live in Texas unfortunately and am waiting on my aid access package which could take up to 3 more weeks. I am about 6 weeks and already having severe nausea and throwing up constantly, canâ€™t seem to get control over this. I am a single, working mom and really struggling to just get through the day. I am sure about my decision to have an abortion, I am just overwhelmed with the physical symptoms and how to get through this alone without anyone aside from my boyfriend knowing as I do fear retaliation where I live. Just hoping to find some support and community here./nI have lab work tomorrow but have had trouble sleeping with this looming over me. I had an abortion a month ago due to severe hyperemesis gravidarum + subsequent suicidal thoughts stemming from how sick I was. This was a very wanted baby and we planned to try again as soon as I can get better medical care. My abortion was nothing out of the ordinary. Medical...I took the pills, I started bleeding on time, I passed clots etc./nI had an at home MA on 8/1 (three weeks ago). The pregnancy appeared to pass as there was a grayish sac that was emptied. The 1st week I a bit heavy to moderate blood with clots. The 2nd week the bleeding stoped and it was just brown discharge. I assumed it was coming to an end by then. The 3rd week I bled so heavy out of nowhere and completely ruined my pants. Since that first heavy bleed again I have been bleeding and passing small to medium clots and stringy clots. The bleeding has not been as heavy as the first heavy bleed on the 3rd week. Could this be my period? I know it may be too soon.../nIâ€™m a male. And me and my girlfriend of 1 year have been planning a baby and sheâ€™s pregnant. We argued for a couple days. And now sheâ€™s wants to abort the baby. I really do not know what to do. This is a terrible feeling. Any advice? I need to speak with someone or vent. Iâ€™m depressed./nI am trying to prepare for it. I have already bought the pills online, I was wondering if I should have anything else. Some people here were recommending diapers, heating pad, snacks, pain meds. Anyone who has been through it please let me know what would make this as easy for me as possible./nHad a consult and they emailed me to confirm my address and name 2 days ago. I replied back and still have not heard back. How long does it normally take to get an email back regarding payment and shipping?/nFinished my miso dose (orally) yesterday at approx 5 weeks. Had cramping and bleeding but not more than a heavy period. Doc prescribed Z-pack. Do I really need antibiotics? I wasn't given antibiotics following vaginal delivery of my son, and that was obviously more traumatic. In the past Z pack has really messed with my stomach and sometimes caused yeast infection. Anyone heard from their doc that antibiotics are optional?/ni (f19) had an abortion back in november and i donâ€™t know how to cope with it. iâ€™ve talked to my boyfriend about it but he doesnâ€™t understand what iâ€™m going through so i canâ€™t get all the support i need. iâ€™ve been thinking about getting a baby doll toy from target or something to try and cope with the loss of my child but i donâ€™t know if thatâ€™ll damage me more./nI just wanna start with, before the abortion, I came on Reddit and I was extremely nervous because of all the horror stories but remember everyoneâ€™s different and to have faith that yours will go smoothly.
The day before around 9am I took the medication at the clinic. I didnâ€™t feel any nausea until the next morning but it didnâ€™t feel any different than the pregnancy symptoms. Fast forward to the morning of where I had to take the second set of pills. Before I took the pills, I prepared myself by taking eating a nice healthy breaking, taking ibuprofen 30 minutes before ,gathering my heating pad, and turning on a favorite movie. I decided to do the pills through my vaginal which to me, is the reason why I didnâ€™t throw up like most. 30 minutes into the pill, I started cramping but just mild cramping, nothing I wasnâ€™t use to from a period. A hour in, I began to bleed heavy AF. I got up from my bed and it was running down my leg and my significant other rushed me to the bathroom and I got in a nice hot shower and put on two pads. I did have minor blood clots and cramping but nothing I havenâ€™t felt before. Itâ€™s just like a period in my opinion./nhii! i took my second set of medications lastnight and bled pretty heavy throughout the night and had 1 large blood clot this morning. since this morning i havenâ€™t really had any bleeding (maybe a light flow IF that) and iâ€™ve been going through my day as i normally would! im nervous, feeling like it should be more. maybe iâ€™m overthinking/nI had my abortion on July 2. I found out i was pregnant again last week with an ultrasound. The ultrasound dated me at 6w1d so i conceived again on July 10, 8 days after my abortion.
The doctor told me it would be 2 weeks before i ovulated again and apparently the birth control i was prescribed (nuvaring) didnt take effect yet./nI finally got my period after having a medical abortion. I thought that it would be a lot heavier and I'd have bad cramps too. Is it also normal to have a lighter flow and less cramping after a MA?/nI have an upcoming appointment. And, I was wondering if you lovely folks, could give me tips on after care. I was planning on going shopping a week before, so I can be prepared./nHi all. I found out I was pregnant few days ago (so now I am 5 weeks). Ever since I have been absolutely miserable. I can't stop vomiting and can't even keep water down. I am 28 with a wonderful husband, but I feel like this is not normal morning sickness and I need to think about my own safety. Is it bad to consider an abortion? Or has anyone else been in this situation?/nWhile I do know experiences vary from person to person, I still wanted to share how the abortion pill went for me to help ease some minds as this can be an incredibly scary situation for anyone
I took the first pill at the clinic and felt fine for the rest of the day (no protesters at the PP by the way. Only some people with brochures trying to flag you down but easily drove past them)/nTomorrow I believe that Iâ€™ll be given the at home abortion package if my pregnancy isnâ€™t dangerous. Iâ€™m having an ultrasound first because the clinician is worried due to cramps and pain that Iâ€™m experiencing in my womb at only 3 weeks pregnant.
But if all is OK/normal can I expect the clinic give me my first pill supervised or do I begin the process when I like at home? What am I to expect with such an early abortion? Any tips to help with pain?/nHey yâ€™all, Iâ€™ve been wondering if their packages are discreet. This is what worries me the MOST! Iâ€™m 20, from TX, and living with my strict parents. I just wouldnâ€™t want my parents to find out!! I had no one else I couldâ€™ve shipped it to but to MY house. Iâ€™ve heard many different stories, please help. But They did warn me that it might have â€œanti preg kitâ€?on the labelsâ€?/p>Before I stepped into the clinic, I was stopped by over by a lady who was telling me what happens in there. She was telling what god wouldâ€™ve wanted and that I was in the wrong for trying to seek help from there. That the people inside there are â€œmurdersâ€?and leave women feeling depressed and suicidal. She said that she would offer to help me through a program she was hosting. However knowing me, Iâ€™m just a minor trying to finish high school, taking care of a child would be burden for myself and the child itself, I wouldnâ€™t be able to give the proper care they deserve. She pleaded for me not to go in there, I understand that sheâ€™s trying to help me, but itâ€™s not my choice. She seems like a nice person overall and I respect her for what she is trying to say. But I just couldnâ€™t let my choice be overweighted by hers. Sorry I meant to go into my in clinic experience but I just wanted to point that out first since it conflicted my views. I thought at first I would be eligible for the medication, however after finding out I was 14 weeks in meant I had to do in clinic. At that point I was desperate and wanted to proceed. The procedure first started with an ultrasound revealing the baby then I took a lot of medication, mostly pain killers. Iâ€™m not sure what the other medication was called but I left it in my mouth for 30 mins to dissolve. 15 mins in and I kinda threw up. Having it linger and getting the taste stuck on your tongue was not it. With the cervix medication I took, I think it helped a lot with the last step of the procedure. I think I took it well since it felt like cramps however I think that just means my pain tolerance is higher. I donâ€™t regret going through this although I do feel ashamed for not being responsible enough to prevent something like this. Iâ€™m taking this time to reflect upon this experience and that I donâ€™t go through this again./nI live in Panama, a country where abortion is illegal and criminalized. I have been looking here and there for options and I only found about a private clinic that performs the abortion for 400 dollars. I don't have that amount of money, if you know of any other option on my country or can help me raise the money, please help me./nHow long until after a MA were you able to drink again?/nI am currently looking for abortion pills that is being sold here in the philippines because I do not know where I can find some./nJust need something I can get without going in . Like paying for it online and getting it delivered/nIs the next period after a miscarriage usually different? I know your uterine lining hasnâ€™t shed the same but I was almost weeks pregnant when I miscarried. I havenâ€™t had a period since and I typically do have heavy periods but this is different. Should the color be this light? Iâ€™m afraid I didnâ€™t actually miscarry and my ex just told me I wasnâ€™t pregnant but wasnâ€™t listening. Like what do I do? Normally my cycle has regular bleeding and my cycles are regulated and normal like clock work. So Iâ€™ve missed two months of bleeding just light spotting then heavy blood and every hospital I went to said I was too early to detect pregnancy hormones but now I justâ€?donâ€™t know. My hormones are torn up I donâ€™t want to feelâ€¦live nothing this is so hard and my ex left me soon as he found out I miscarried. Iâ€™m horrified I never wanted to go through this again. My mother just tells me she went through it and this isnâ€™t normal but every womanâ€™s body is different. Iâ€™m really confused. The first time I miscarried it was after a surgical abortion and I remember the smell. I didnâ€™t have a smell this time justâ€¦blood and they said it was implantation bleeding. Iâ€™m scared. The doctors Iâ€™ve gone to give me antibiotics and test my urine and have taken my blood but I still canâ€™t access my patient portal. I donâ€™t know what to do at this point. OBGYNs are booked up until fall time basically, Planned parenthood is over 350 dollars just to be seen and I have no state health insurance/nI just got back from doing the in-clinic procedure at planned parenthood and I just wanted to try and ease the stress for anyone who's scared. The people at planned parenthood took amazing care of me and the procedure really only was like a 5-10 minute process. I would personally recommend going the in-clinic route over the pill. I'm only dealing with some very mild cramping and light bleeding. I had so much fear going into this but I can't even begin to express the relief I feel now./nMy 24 year old niece is about 9wks pregnant she just found out but she is in a state that only allows abortion up to 6wks, she is in a bad situation and needs help, what are her options? She does not want to continue the pregnancy./nI'm 34 in the best state that hates women, Oklahoma, where forced birth is the law. This was a hard decision. I have literally gone back and forth everyday, sometimes by the hour-depending on if social media was showing me babies. I am told that I'm 7 wks 3 days pregnant but I know exactly what days I had sex which makes me 5 1/2 wks. I had an ultra-sound this week and it had a pretty loud and visible heartbeat. I was expecting one so I didn't freak out. This is my 5th pregnancy. I had a SA when I was 16 and 19, a miscarriage at 22, a child at 23, and now currently pregnant at 34. This is definitely the most difficult pregnancy to have to decide on what's best for everyone. Mainly me, of course. I have no family and I've been isolating bc I've been in a caretaking role with the father. He's a non-functional alcoholic who I've been trying to help the last 4 years. I thought I had control of myself but I don't. If he weren't in this situation and I thought he had empathy, this would be way harder than it already is. I told my therapist first, then him and he didn't even hug me. No comfort, it was all about him. The only feedback I got from him was that I need to get an abortion. Everyone else has been too supportive of "my choice" whatever it is. I've always felt a sense of urgency and intuition on basically everything. Apparently, I just need to know the future bc my intuition isn't working! These damn hormones have me balling about everything, it's terrible! I swear that facebook is feeding me baby videos so I cry. Automation isn't helping my patience either. Sorry, I had to rant about how insane pregnancy makes me feel. I'm glad I finally found my sound mind decision to get a MA although I'm scared. It's one of the scariest things I've experienced-being a mother, being pregnant, always filled with worry. People understand why I would get an abortion and I see that most people who post aren't in a terrible sounding position but you don't have to be in order to come to this kind of choice. It's f*cking ridiculous that we have to seek information outside our doctors. I don't feel safe like this./nIâ€™ll include images in comments.
I had a surgical abortion a little over 2 weeks ago and had little to no bleeding after my abortion. All my pregnancy symptoms are still present, with the exception of hyperemesis gravidarum.
I also noticed last night my stomach looked bigger, and I usually donâ€™t get bloated. I also hadnâ€™t eaten or drank for a few hours./nI had a medication abortion at 5 weeks in early may. Itâ€™s been almost 4 months and Iâ€™m entering my 4th period back. BEFORE my abortion my cycle was extremely regular (27 days usually), I never had spotting, and my boobs would always hurt the few days before my period. I was not on birth control then and am not on birth control now./nI live in a state where abortion is illegal after approximately 6 weeks gestation. I am looking to travel out of state to get abortion pills. My preferred method of travel would be by plane, but I am not sure if TSA would allow me to travel with the pills in a carry on bag. Any insights? I appreciate you all!/nSo for a short back story, I was 7 weeks pregnant when I had my MA. I experienced bad cramps and heavy bleeding for 3 weeks to the point if was streaming out when I went to the toilet. I went to emergency and they decided I needed a D + C. I am kinda glad because I was over the pain and heavy bleeding. They removed 20mil of tissue. I havenâ€™t had any cramping just little sharp pains and spotting./nSo my husband and I found out that Iâ€™m pregnant Iâ€™m about 4.5 weeks counting from my last menstrual cycle. I wasnâ€™t even aware I was pregnant and due to stress I thought I just had a late period. I found out because I went to the emergency room because our daughter had an ear infection and I was very sick, I had cold like symptoms and a huge headache. Anyway they saw our daughter first then me, the doctor asked me if I wanted a Covid test and asked me when was my last menstrual cycle, I knew I was late but I thought yeah sure why not, not thinking anything of it like I said I thought I was late due to stress. Anyway 30 minutes pass and the doctor comes in and said weâ€™ll you tested positive for Covid and your pregnancy test also came out positive. I was just more disappointed about my pregnancy test coming out positive than my Covid test. A lot of things came rushing to my head. Like â€œweâ€™re not financially stable! Our daughter is just starting pre-k! Iâ€™m no longer going to have time for myself! To finish my school! And last thing I thought was the world is too shitty to bring another human being!â€?Anyway that was that and I stopped thinking about it and started shifting my attention to our daughter I saw her differently because I love her so much and I donâ€™t know how to process the news I just heard. Anyway we leave I tell my husband the news and he was just as shocked but very supportive he said itâ€™s ok weâ€™ll figure it out, and I told him my reasons why I donâ€™t want another child and he empathized and understood and he agreed with me also and he said weâ€™ll whatever you wanna do Iâ€™m on your side whether you want to keep it or get rid of it. Which made my decision easy. So we want an abortion but unfortunately we live in Texas and I need information as where we can go get the surgical procedure done he needs to ask for days off at work so we can go but we donâ€™t know where to begin. But In a way I also feel guilty for being selfish, Iâ€™ve been a stay at home mom ever since our daughters been born and finally she started school and I finally wanted to start working on myself and my confidence but Iâ€™m human and I have feelings so Iâ€™ve been feeling guilty and selfish for thinking about me. Is it wrong? Idk I just need advice as well. Thank you for listening/nHi I (23F) wanted to share my story and some advice/tips because I did a lot of research (ofc ask your doctor for what works best) and I came to reddit for support.
Overall it wasn't terrible the anticipation was the worst part.
I found out I was pregnant at five weeks on my birthday! (woo) and tried to set up a virtual appointment but it was denied after they screened me saying I needed an ultrasound. So, I had to go into a planned parenthood the next week, and honestly I recommend this even if it is inconvenient./nI found out i was pregnant on New Yearâ€™s Eve with a guy i had been seeing for about a month and a half. Within that month and a half he started displaying red flags and toxic behavior and once i found out about the pregnancy i knew he wouldnâ€™t be a stable/reliable father. I never told him about the pregnancy as i wanted to really think about things without any pressure. Went to PP early January and ended up needing more time to think about things. Ended up going back 2 weeks later and went through with an MA without ever telling him. This guy and i have been off and on ever since and he continues to display more toxic behavior so i know my judgement on him being a father was correct. I do regret my decision some days but i remember my initial judgement and remember how poorly he treated me without ever knowing i was pregnant with his child. My question is how do you move on from someone whose child you were pregnant with? I feel like Iâ€™m bonded with him because of this. Every time he tries to come back into my life i allow him to because i feel like thereâ€™s that special place in my heart for him. Sorry for the rant and if it doesnâ€™t make sense, just super emotional because i would have been due in a couple of weeksðŸ¥º/nSo my circumstances changed to where I was approved for an in hospital SA under general anesthesia. I had stopped by planned parenthood bc I trust them a whole lot more but i was ineligible for any insurance coverage or emergency medi-cal so it wouldve been 782 for 8 weeks for the in clinic procedure (word to anyone in SD county). That was a bit of a high price and I don't want to take any abortion funds from those who really need it so i called my OB and was told that i was eligible to have it done under general at the hospital with my insurance covering 90% of the cost. Very fortunate I did not have to be awake for it. Minimal bleeding and cramping as usual./nI'll try to keep this short. I found out I was pregnant on May 30. Had an SA done at Planned Parenthood on June 10. Everything went smoothly. I bled for about 3 weeks (June 12-July 3) and then got my period on July 21 which lasted 5 days (my normal period length pre-pregnancy). I'm getting nervous because my period is late. Before pregnancy I was usually a 28 day cycle. Sometimes it would be a day or two early or late, but it was pretty regular every month. I am now on cycle day 31 and haven't had any symptoms that my period is coming. I had protected sex with condoms twice since my period and he also pulled out to be extra careful. I took a dollar store pregnancy test on Thursday (Aug 18) and today (Aug 20) and both came up negative. I looked very carefully and in different lighting to see if there was even a faint second line, but they were both very clearly negative. Is this my body just playing tricks on me? It very well could be stress because I am starting a new job in the next few weeks and I've been worried about this as well. I will probably go to the store tomorrow and buy a First Response test because I've read they are more accurate if you are still early on. Any thoughts?/nJust found this subreddit and want to say that Iâ€™m here to talk if anyone needs it and if anyone wants to talk, Iâ€™m here. Not doing well.
Slept a lot after the procedure, but have been up all night. Trying to take showers when the panic attacks get too strong.
Just not doing well. Reaching out./nSo idk where to ask except this place. But my â€œperiodâ€?comes early 4 days and with really heavy cramp, however i check the upt and its negative. The pain is pretty similar to abortion, i dont think its period pain but how come the upt is negative. Bear in mind my period last month came like expected. I also passed some big cloth, is it period? Or is it miscarriage, can someone who has abortion at 1 month tell me what did u feel during it? I dont want to go to the hospital emergency for period pain.. but i dont think this cramp is normal/nHello, Iâ€™d like to preface im in my first trimester for sure and I really donâ€™t have any money. I barely have money for the abortion. Do I have to get an ultrasound beforehand? I have barely any money and have to rely on my parents for this and I just want to cut out whatâ€™s not absolutely necessary./nI took the 1st abortion pill at planned parenthood on Thursday at about 4pm. I took the other 4 once I got home Friday night (Saturday morning) at about 1am. I did have pretty bad cramps and bleeding within an hour or two, and passed a lot of small clots. But otherwise I slept from 1 to 10 am. Getting up every 2ish hours(give or take) to go to the bathroom and change my maxi pad. The amount of blood never completely covered or soaked any of the pads, but there was a good amount (like a normal heavy period). That covered maybe a little less than half the pad/nI have not taken Miso yet. I was told by the doctor that the only symptom to expect from Miso is vomiting (which she said was rare). I threw up violently 30 minutes after taking Miso and now Iâ€™ve started bleeding and already passed a large mass. My anxiety is getting the best of me and Iâ€™m starting to feel light headed. Did anyone else experience bleeding after only taking Miso?/nI took the medical abortion pill about 3 weeks ago. And have been bleeding since. Now I read that it could last a good 6 weeks so Iâ€™m not too worried about that portion. However some days the bleeding is light but other days it is super heavy and Iâ€™m bleeding through super plus tampons. I am also still passing blood clots bigger than a quarter but not quite the size of a lemon. Iâ€™m not sure if this is something that I should go get checked out or if itâ€™s just normal and will take time to pass. Also could anyone tell me how long it took for them to stop bleeding? TIA/nI got pregnant 7 weeks ago. I live with my grandfather because my dad has been emotionally, physically, verbally abusive and very manipulative since I can remember. Things only got worse when my mom passed away in 2019. I donâ€™t have any savings, iâ€™ve spent thousands to fix my car but it still wonâ€™t start, and where I live everywhere is so expensive unless you go to the shady side of town. My boyfriend and I decided abortion is the best option because we want to raise the baby in the happiest healthiest environment and we cannot provide that right now. I looked to my older sister for support and guidance through this but we was the absolute opposite. â€œThatâ€™s my niece or nephew youâ€™re hurtingâ€?â€œIâ€™m so stressed because of this. I cant believe youâ€?making it about herself. She finally came to terms with it and knew when my appointment was. Yesterday we left the state at 5 am for my appointment at 9:30am. I took the first pill and went to the hotel. I wasnâ€™t as sad as I thought I would be. I was confident that I made the right decision and I felt some relief. I laid down to take a nap at around 6:30pm when I receive an anonymous phone call. I answered and it was my dad. â€œDonâ€™t do it baby, thatâ€™s a lifeâ€? I was in absolute horror and shock and hung up. Thatâ€™s the first time hes reached out to me in two months. He then called me 5 more. times and called my boyfriend. He sent him several texts saying â€œDonâ€™t let her do this you need to get her under controlâ€?â€œYouâ€™re a scumbag piece of shit. Thatâ€™s a baby youâ€™re killing.â€?My boyfriend responded with something along the lines of â€œItâ€™s her body and ultimately her decision. I support her in whatever she wants to do and I donâ€™t want to control her.â€?he responded word for word â€œBullshit you little piece of shit fucking liar that's what you want it and that's what you got your fucking scumbagâ€?my boyfriend didnâ€™t respond because we know that any response is fuel for him. My dad continued to text him like that and my boyfriend eventually blocked him. He got my younger brother to call me and tell me to keep the baby and now iâ€™m scared that my entire small town is gonna know what I did. I was feeling so confident in my decision but now iâ€™m just scared. Iâ€™m scared of whatâ€™s to come when I get back in town and iâ€™m scared iâ€™ve done the wrong thing. Iâ€™ve been shaking and crying all night. My sister waited until it was too late to look back. She did this on purpose. She did this to not only traumatize me but also my father. My younger sister is so pissed off at her so I at least have her on my side. I guess my older sister told her that sheâ€™s been shaking and she regrets telling him. HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL? She was probably upset for 20 mins because my dad said he wouldnâ€™t pay for her gym membership anymore. Iâ€™m just so stressed. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like a terrible person and I never want to step foot in my town ever again. I feel betrayed. Any and all advice would be so appreciated and if anyones been through something like this please let me know how you moved past it./nThe last months after my abortion have been extremely hard on me. Sometimes I get panic attacks and feel extremely sad, other days I'm more or less feeling okay or even good. I'm finally starting to trust that it will get better. My boyfriend hasn't been that supportive when I needed him (he'll be tired, busy, stressed). I feel like he tries to be there sometimes, but he just doesn't really know how or he gets overwhelmed with my emotions? I have not been able to really talk with him about it even though I try and we live together. He is just really busy with work/study/friends and when he spends time with me he wants us to relax and enjoy (which is sweet but also often means we don't talk about difficult things or emotions). Anyway. After my abortion I got a copper IUD to prevent from getting pregnant again. We waited to have sex until after I got it checked with an ultrasound. It was all good. But since then it took him time to want to have sex again, not wanting to cum inside me. Which is okay, I understand he is more cautious now. But I don't want to be so scared of getting pregnant again, I feel like this fear is holding me back from getting through this all. He is making sure I track my cycle and now asked me to do a pregnancy test because I felt a little sick yesterday (even though I had my period 2 weeks ago). I don't know what to do. I just want to support him, I try to understand this fear he has. But I also need more of his support to get through this./nWe both don't have plans to keep the baby and she is 5 weeks pregnant. Is there anything we could do to abort the baby? If so what can we do to abort it?/nI got my abortion back in June 21 I Counted and itâ€™s about 9 weeks now. I know that itâ€™s typically 4-8 weeks. It did take me a while to stop bleeding completely. I was still releasing some very tiny amounts of blood and tissue up until 3 weeks ago. (Beginning of August) so I took 2 pregnancy tests before and it came back negative. And I just took another one 4 days ago still negative. should I just keep taking more tests and see or could it be another reason that is why I am not getting a period yet? I am not on any birth control either that would cause a delay in my period./nHad an abortion July 5, got light spotting beginning of august /late July and period around mid august! I keep releasing these blood clots that look like uterine lining . I have took a pregnancy test post abortion that came out negative . I was wondering if this has happend to anyone! I keep reading that a D&C procedure is necessary to remove all tissue but Iâ€™m wondering if it will be a problem because I live in Georgia!/nAfter being unable to get pregnant for the past ten years, suddenly (after the roe vs Wade hearing) I manage to get pregnant by some strange twist of fate. I live in a state that illegalized abortions. Does anyone know of any ways to help induce miscarriage? Please help/nI'm pregnant, again. I had my abortion last month. It happened because the copper IUD the ob inserted was out of place. They did not told me to use condoms before being sure of the good placement of the IUD. The midwife that did the ultrasound to check did not tell me it was partially perforating my uterus, and that it was useless. I feel betrayed and helpless. Abortion was hard for me, it was the hardest choice I made. I can't believe I have to live this again./nJust curious I can't see anywhere online where it says that it cancels birth control I hope not/nI just started the first step of my second MA. Im less than 5 weeks along. Iâ€™m having a really hard time with this because I never thought Iâ€™d be in this position once let alone twice. Iâ€™m feeling sad, guilty and so ashamed.
Iâ€™m in my 4th year of school and although Iâ€™d like to add another child to my family, itâ€™s just absolutely not the right time. I promised myself I would finish school and better myself first. Not to mention, with cost of everything rising where I live, we just arenâ€™t in the financial position to add another in. Deep down I know this is the right decision and my significant other is extremely supportive but I just canâ€™t help but feel sad./nHey everyone. I have made a couple posts in here the past week, but now that my experience is basically done with I wanted to share. I found out I was pregnant 8/10 and had an appointment 8/13 at A Preferred Womenâ€™s Health Care in Atlanta. That appointment was awful, they were so rude to me and the place was so so so so sketchy, and you couldnâ€™t even bring your phone or anything in so it made the whole experience even scarier. They denied me a surgical procedure since I was so early (only 4 weeks at the time) because they couldnâ€™t see anything on my vaginal ultrasound. This made sense but was still disappointing and the way they handled the situation was not nice at all. They told me I could come back in about a week and they may be able to do it, but they seemed so unsure and with the new GA law not allowing abortions at around 6 weeks now I was so on edge. I also was not wanting to do an MA due to my situation and who I live with who I cannot let find out about this. I was crushed and my best friend drove me back home. I researched more options for me and came across Carafem and saw they did have an Atlanta location not too far from me. I booked online which was super simple and easy and was able to make my appointment for that following Tuesday 8/16. I talked to the Carafem workers and we also emailed back and forth and they assured me they would do everything to be able to perform the procedure on me even though I would still be very early./nI had my MA July 5 and tonight I just went thru a spree and felt my self drop a lot of blood clots. Is this normal ? Has anyone experienced this? If so how long does it last ? A couple days ago I had clots here and there but tonight it feels like my body just wants to release it all/nI am 7 weeks pregnant and Iâ€™m terrified as abortion is illegal in Lebanon. Does anyone know any professional gynecologist that performs the operation?
Please help me/nIâ€™m worried./nIâ€™m about 4-7 weeks. Found out a week ago. Abortion in AZ is really weird right now; should I try a telehealth appointment for the MA pills to get shipped to me? Iâ€™m not sure of the best route & im starting to freak out. Any help would be amazing. Iâ€™m not sure which clinics or websites are legit. Thank you so much./nim kind of scared, 6w1d so far. idk any resources other to my clinic (they take like an hr to respond) so if anyone has anything please send links. i took the mifepristone Wednesday at 7:30 pm and took the miso 8:50 pm vaginally(4 x 200mg) . i had very bad cramps for 5 hrs and nausea but thatâ€™s it. also living i. a state where this is illegal so emergency care isnt too viable for me rn. this is worrying me bc every post iâ€™ve read has said â€œdw if it doesnâ€™t pass immediately, mine took 4 hrsâ€?and iâ€™m way past that. thoughts or experiences ?/nI'm 5 weeks + 4 days, got pregnant on the pill (I had stomach flu, so that's probably the reason). I can't decide if I want an abortion or not. I've known for two weeks now and I just can't make up my mind. I have really bad anxiety that makes it hard to make any decisions in my life, so this huge life changing decision is really kicking my ass. How do I know what is the right choice, how did you make up your mind? I'm the most pro choice person there is - but I'm not sure if I want the pregnancy to end./nSo I just put the 4 miso buccaly and now I await the 30 minutes and the unknown. I have read countless shared stories on here, and I hope I've prepared enough. Wish me luck. ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ«¶ðŸ¼ðŸ«¶ðŸ¼ I'm currently 7w 3d.
UPDATES:
15:41 - end of 40 minutes and swallowed the miso. Prior to this I took anti-nausea (Bonamine) and Medicol Advance 400mg./nJust wondering what the typical timeline is in terms of changes on tracking sites.
I got my tracking number 2 days ago but usps still says label created, not yet in the system. What does this mean? When does it change?/nIâ€™m not sure where else to post this, but what are the chances my surgical abortion failed..?
I had an abortion 2-3 weeks ago and I was about 8 weeks along. I didnâ€™t have any bleeding afterwards, only for one day and it was 4 days after the abortion. I had hyperemesis gravidarum during my pregnancy. Itâ€™s gone away since, but Iâ€™m starting to feel really nauseous and like i felt when i was pregnant. I havenâ€™t had sex since I was pregnant so a new pregnancy is impossible. None of my pregnancy symptoms have gone away either and Iâ€™ve actually started growing milk ducts..? They will grow, go away, then grow in new places on my nipple./nI went in for my procedure today at the PP clinic. Turns out I was 16/17 weeks, but 20 weeks and 3 days. They stopped to talk to the doctor to see if they could proceed. Anything after 19.6 weeks, they double check before going further up until 20.6 weeks.
It was decided they couldn't do my procedure for several reasons. How far along I am, my age (42F), my BMI, and the possibility of my IUD still being in me. They couldn't find the IUD on the ultrasound. They wanted me to go somewhere that does heavier sedation for my safety and comfort./nhey so i got my first period after a MA in july (20th to be exact) and iâ€™m just wondering what should i expect? iâ€™ve seen some horror stories and while iâ€™m glad to have my monthly time back im nervous if there will be any drastic changes i should be made aware of./niâ€™ve had my MA 6 days ago, iâ€™ve bleed and i felt some clots passed, but i didnâ€™t look for an embryo or the sac, i got scared that i didnâ€™t know if i pushed it out, the day after my MA, i couldnâ€™t stand for too long and walk because my body specially my lower back hurts but after that day i felt normal, im still have some spotting, What are the chances that my MA failed because the lower right side of my stomach hurts when I press it and my breast feels firmer?/nSo. Iâ€™ll try to make this short and simple. My soon to be ex husband was stationed down in FL and I went down there to visit him end of March/beginning of april. I found out I was pregnant when I got back home and thatâ€™s when everything went to shit.
My stbx lost his mind and was PISSED. We werenâ€™t trying to get pregnant but it happened and I was scared and I didnâ€™t know what to do. I had an abortion to save my marriage basically. He wasnâ€™t there for any of it. Like ANY of it. I was so sick vomiting every single day and working full time./nMy MA isnâ€™t until the 29th & im having a rough time with this morning sickness. Is there anything I can take that will help with this?/njust inserted the miso vaginally 15minutes ago. feeling so so nervous and emotional. i was just barely 6 weeks today. nothings happened except sudden, possibly unrelated, gassiness. fortunately I was very prepared though, heatpad, ibuprofen, water, etc. but im scared for the next 6 hrs. i definitely dont regret this decision, but i dont think anyone can deny how horrifying this can be as a woman haha/nJust looking for advice to see if if itâ€™s a positive or negative experience Thanks in advance/nI thought I would share as I spent 2 weeks reading othersâ€?stories on here before going through with my procedure and found some comfort in them. I found out I was pregnant at exactly 4 weeks.
On Tuesday night I took my mifepristone pill at 6 weeks 1 day. Felt fine, had some minor cramping through the next day, but I had also already been cramping prior to the pill, so not sure if it was related or not. The cramping felt as if I would have started my period, but had absolutely no bleeding with this one alone. I went to work and came home anxious to start my second set of pills, misoprostol (4) orally./nJust wondering if anyone has any experience in getting a surgical procedure such as D&E procedure after a medical abortion? Tia/nhi! i just have a quick question. i know and i am aware that any unprotected sex can cause pregnancy. however, what are the chances of getting pregnant if: you had sex 5 days after your period, only the tip of the penis goes in, and your partner pulled out before ejaculation. it's only been 7 days after we had an intercourse, too early for a test. just seeking advice/opinion for my peace of mind as the waiting game is kinda causing me anxiety. thank u!/nMy abortion is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon and I have been torturing myself going back and forth for a few weeks now. Just wish someone could make this decision for me so I didnâ€™t have to deal with the burden. I am 9 weeks and found out at 5 weeks. Itâ€™s been a struggle from the very beginning. There is something beautiful and wholesome about being pregnant and I have always wanted to be a mom one day, but I just wasnâ€™t prepared for that day to be in 7 months. I think Iâ€™m especially struggling with this because my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and have talked about having children together one day. We recently hit a rough patch in our relationship and we were talking about going our separate ways. Then literally the very next day I found out I was pregnant. We are doing better now but I certainly donâ€™t want to have a child to save a relationship. I feel like this would be an easier decision if I got pregnant with a one night stand. But it was with someone I have a lot of love and history with. He supports my decision either way but I know if it were up to him, he is for the abortion. We both make decent money and have a great support system so again, that makes this decision even harder. I just want to feel like I am making the best decision and I want to feel at peace with it. I am so scared of feeling regret. Iâ€™ve never been so emotionally drained like this in my life. Please help./nHi all, just curious about getting your first period after a medical abortion. From what Iâ€™ve read online, I canâ€™t really get a straight answer. It says you can expect your first period 4-8 weeks after your MA. Does that mean 4-8 weeks from the day you had the actual abortion, or 4-8 weeks from when you stop bleeding from the abortion? I had my MA on july 1, and bled up until august 12. Now I just have the lightest pink colored blood here & there, with and without a tiny bit of discharge. Wondering if itâ€™s my period coming? Thanks in advance :)/nIs there anyone who knows where I can get abortion pills please I dont want this to ruin my future. I really regret having sex/nHow long does it usually take for the package from aid access to get through US customs?

I didnâ€™t feel anything and no bleeding.. then I took my 4 misoprostol about 28 hours later- I took them bucally and did exactly as directed. I was expecting the worst cramps and bleeding but honestly Iâ€™ve passed one blood clot that wasnâ€™t very big and very little bleeding. Iâ€™m worried it isnâ€™t working, and it feels like the bleeding is slowly stopping. I am worried I didnâ€™t pass enough for it to be completeâ€?/p>Can everyone please remind me of how safe the In clinic SA is.

(The payment went through) I live in a red state and Iâ€™m so nervous that somehow this will go wrong. I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m pregnant, I just had a messy situation about 2 weeks ago and I want to be prepared. I am nervous my bank account will report something somewhere. Ugh, Iâ€™m a wreck./nhi everyone. leading up to my MA, i spent hours going through this subreddit and reading everyoneâ€™s stories. they really helped put my mind at ease, especially when i had my doubts and worries. i figured i would share my story too, maybe itâ€™ll help someone one day.
i took the mife monday evening around 7 pm. i didnâ€™t have any symptoms besides some slight cramping and light bleeding. i took the anti nausea meds and ibuprofen a half an hour before taking it so i wouldnâ€™t be nauseous./nSo I took the first pill last night. I was planning on taking the other 4 tonight, but I started bleeding. Do I still need to take the 4 miso pills or is this enough? Thanks!/nI am 7 weeks pregnant. Iâ€™ve known for 2 weeks and have my abortion scheduled for tomorrow morning. The closer it gets, the more I am feeling worried and doubting my choice.

The first day of my last period was July 17th. Last week I was feeling some cramping, pretty normal around the time I would start my period. I thought for sure Monday morning, Mother Nature would wake me up like usual every month. She didnâ€™t./nso i had my MA back in may, and really struggled emotionally the first few weeks (i imagine hormones). i used to put my period before pregnancy into a due date calendar that would tell me how far along i would be but stopped because it wasn't helping me move on, but i always roughly knew how far along i'd be. well last night i had a dream that i was 22 weeks pregnant. i have pregnancy dreams sometimes but it's usually finding out/having a scare, not halfway through. when i woke up i went back to that due date calendar and realised that i would have been around 22 weeks if i hadn't had the abortion./nNo cramps, no blood, no nausea, nothing.

I got my first SA at 6 weeks. I got the procedure done about 1 week and 1 day ago. Iâ€™ve had very light bleeding, basically spotting every day since my procedure. I finally decided to have sex because I went one whole day without spotting. After sex Iâ€™m bleeding more, still light. But just bleeding more than I was before. Has this happened to anyone else? How long has your spotting went on? Just anyone with any situation similar please share experiences please!/nMy boyfriend (26) and I (24) got pregnant after being together for 1 year. I am working full time, and have a part time job while also taking college classes. We have always talked about in the past that if we were to get pregnant before we were ready and financially stable, we would get an abortion. I was all on board until I got the ultrasound and found out something that I wished for my whole life but thought would never happen to me. They told me I was 7 weeks pregnant with twins. I grew up just wanting to be a mom. I always wanted twins but knew it would be difficult because it does not run in my family. Bf informed me later that his grandfather was a twin. It completely crushed me. I knew that I was not financially stable, or ready to raise two children and I didnâ€™t want to go back on the promise I made him. We decided to go through with the abortion. Itâ€™s been one week and I have been a wreck. Does anyone have advice on how I can cope with these feelings of regret? I have no negative feelings towards my relationship and he has been very supportive and has been there every step of the way. But I feel guilty sharing my regret./ntw // sa

I was slow to figure out birth control (obviously), but just didn't think getting pregnant this soon when I'm still breastfeeding would be very likely (at all). My husband and I are already pretty overwhelmed with our first (in good and difficult ways), and the notion of handling two under two just seems so overwhelming and all consuming. I saw my OB today (who knew why I was coming in) and she told me the best option would be to go to planned parenthood to get meds, because a pharmacy wouldn't necessarily give me the meds (I guess for ideological reasons since it's legal in my state). I thought this was super odd. She also scolded me for not getting on birth control sooner. I know this isn't an ideal situation, but I'm also frustrated that my doctor would kindof make me jump through hoops and use the time to reprimand me...Anyone else had difficulty getting meds from their OB and experienced being turned away at a pharmacy? Also, I feel like the latter would be illegal...guess I'm just looking for a sounding board.../nHi Reddit
Iâ€™m 18 and pregnant. Iâ€™m not ready to have a baby yet for obvious reasons; Iâ€™m still living at home, Iâ€™m still in education, Iâ€™m not financially stable and I just donâ€™t want to be a mother yet. I got the abortion pills in the post yesterday - Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™ve taken the first tablet and after work today Iâ€™m going to proceed with the next two steps. Iâ€™m just under 5 weeks into the pregnancy, will it hurt less because Iâ€™m only early into the pregnancy? Iâ€™m just so scared. Iâ€™ve got work the next day (so the process canâ€™t take longer than 14 hours, is this possible or will it last longer?)and no other opportunity to do it for the next few weeks.

I was 11 weeks in with twins. I just took a normal pregnancy test from the drugstore and I am seeing an incredibly feint line. I had an ultrasound two weeks after which said everything was fine.
Almost canâ€™t see the line but Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s there. I did have one of those Kyleena IUDs put in place when I had the pregnancy termination. I know they mess up your period, but my skin has been breaking out and i donâ€™t know, just wanted to put my mind at ease. Is it possible that itâ€™s detecting hormone levels from the previous pregnancy 5 weeks ago?/nI had my SA on Thursday. I know I made the right decision- Iâ€™ve never once wanted kids. The guy who got me pregnant broke up with me early last month. Iâ€™ve had feelings I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d have in this situation and itâ€™s confusing me. Just looking for some support/nI (26F) found out i was pregnant maybe 2 weeks ago, and itâ€™s only been a few months since my MA (i had it March 11). Now, one thing I keep questioning is: would it be possible that my abortion failed the first time? And that itâ€™s still just the same pregnancy? I was bleeding clots and for quite amount of time, and then got what i thought to be my period a few times. But, I wonder this because my boyfriend was told by a doctor itâ€™s nearly impossible for him to have kids after his drug/alcohol addiction basically ruined his body years ago. They said it was near a .01% chance. So either this is another miracle baby, or his body somehow repaired itself..? Idk, now i definitely dont want to go through with an abortion again, and feel Iâ€™m financially much better off to support a child BUT me and my boyfriend have been going thru it. I found out last month he was cheating on me (among other things) for a couple months and iâ€™m still not over it. And, i dont want to feel like i have to get over it quicker just because now thereâ€™s a baby involved. BUT, idk if i should get an abortion because selfishly, i want to raise a baby with someone not by co partenting. I feel like i do want this baby, but i dont know if itâ€™s a good idea given weâ€™re still trying to work things out. Am i a terrible person because the ONE and ONLY reason i dont want to have this child is because i want my baby to have a two parent household ? I know there isnâ€™t nessesarilly a â€œwrongâ€?reason for having an abortion, if you dont want a baby you should never have to go thru with a pregnancy but i feel guilty because i do have the ability to raise a child now so why wouldnt i just keep them?/nIâ€™m 19 years old and 9 weeks pregnant. My boyfriend and I know this is the best decision and this is what we need to do, but Iâ€™m extremely nervous. I canâ€™t talk to many people in my personal life because fear of judgment and pressure. I need to keep this hidden for a while at least. I feel alone here, even with my supportive boyfriend. I just need support with this./nI will make a list of the points for easier readability
My partner has gotten pregnant even though she had an IUD. We live in a country where its illegal to abort and we are a bit worried about this because I want to get her checked up./nHi!
I've been dealing with being depressed after having my abortion but not out of regret which is confusing. I had my abortion about four months ago and honestly I haven't been the same since. It feels like a chemical thing rather than about the actual event. I had a pretty traumatic experience when it happened in regards to how my body physically reacted(medical abortion) and some stuff that had happened with my partner at the time in relation to it. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience with struggling emotionally afterwards even if they had no regrets in making the decision./nHey! I'm currently delayed for a day, it might be kind of early to overthink but I am kind of anxious. I had unprotected sex last Wednesday, August 10whereas my period should've come yesterdayAugust 16.
It was my first sex after 2 years and as I can recall before, sex days pre period and after ovulation + adding the fact that I have a PCOS too (difficulty to get pregnant immediately)â€? I would have a lesser chance of getting pregnant. However, anxiety takes over me now since we did withdrawal without any condom./nI am in the states but my culture is very conservative. There's alot of pressure to listen to the elders and my husband. Theres not alot that goes on that my husband is not aware of.
We already have 2 kids. The youngest is still a baby and I am not ready for a third kid. I recently found out I am about 7-8 weeks pregnant. I was able to order a MA kit without my H knowing. He is aware of the pregnancy. Abortion isn't something that's acceptable but I feel it is the best thing for me./nI need to talk about this somewhere because I am still processing all of it.

Tl/dr: I'm pregnant, and for a lot of reasons I don't want it. I have an abortion scheduled for Thursday. Stay on top of your medical appointments./nI took the first pill today, and the next two will be on Thursday. I have previously had one MA before, but donâ€™t remember being this anxious.
Iâ€™m lying here awake at 11pm, tired but canâ€™t sleep. Heart is pounding, I get waves of anxiety. Iâ€™ve got tears streaming down my face./nIt will be 2 weeks this Friday since I've taken the meds. The blood won't stop and it stinks some days it smells like straight metal other days it just stinks. I did start using my disc because I thought that would make it end quicker but it hasn't. I just want to be done bleeding. Help/nIâ€™m honestly feeling pretty good. I was only 5 weeks along so the bleeding hasnâ€™t been too terribly heavy. Today has been the worst for cramping. I have zero regrets in my decision. The father left before the pregnancy was even confirmed. Feeling a lot of emotions right now because it all happened so fast./nI'm single and living in Dubai and I got pregnant from some random guy I hooked up with while traveling. I know, I should have known better and I blame myself entirely. I can't have the baby here since I'm not married and I can't go back home in Asia as I can't take care of it there without my job here in Dubai. I also dont know how my family would react. The first one was when I was 29 with my then boyfriend and I did it back home where it was illegal. I was lucky I lived and still got back in UAE. I went to Turkey for this one. I was 5 weeks pregnant. I was also drinking, vaping and had weed bec i didnt know i was pregnant. I feel so stupid and guilty. I kept thinking if things would have worked out if ever I decided to keep this baby but I can't barely take care of myself with my anxiety and depression. But still I think what if. I don't know how to be normal again, I feel like I'm losing my mind./ni went in saturday for an abortion. they couldnâ€™t see anything via vaginal ultrasound but, also did tests to see if i had pain anywhere indicating an ectopic pregnancy, which i didnâ€™t. still do not have any pains indicating itâ€™s ectopic. took the second dose of my abortion pills on sunday, bled through the night but no bleeding during the day. come today, cramping like regular period, nothing too harsh. no severe cramps or over bleeding occurred either. no pains in my side or shoulder./nHey everyone. I posted here about a week ago about having a surgical abortion. I had my appointment today at carafem and it went so good. I was nervous of being denied the procedure since I was so early but they did blood work and went ahead with the procedure and I just have to get blood work again in 2 days to make sure hormone levels are dropping again like normal. As far as the procedure goes it was definitely uncomfortable especially since I was only numbed and had Tylenol but definitely bearable and super fast! The staff was so supportive and nice and I literally couldnâ€™t have asked for a better experience. A few hours later and I feel okay, just spotting and crampy. Iâ€™m able to go about my day. I also drove myself there and back. I guess Iâ€™m just on here to share my experience and also see if anyone has had a SA this early and if it was successful? Iâ€™m mainly scared that my blood work will show it wasnâ€™t completed and Iâ€™ll have to go through it again. Literally just my anxiety taking overðŸ˜… I just want this to be over with./nI just wanted to let you know that no matter the reason for you choosing an abortion weâ€™re here for you. If you want to tell your story thatâ€™s fine, but itâ€™s not a requirement. You donâ€™t have to justify your abortion. You also donâ€™t need to feel any guilt. You are the only person who can decide whether continuing a pregnancy is the right option or not for you. Love yâ€™all./nIâ€™m scared. And I canâ€™t talk to anyone else about this because all of my family are really religious or pro life etc. so here I am. Making my first post to Reddit looking for some support. I donâ€™t want anymore kids. Iâ€™m making the appointment tomorrow. Fingers crossed Iâ€™m under the deadline for the state Iâ€™m in. As much as I genuinely donâ€™t want another kid I canâ€™t help but think about if they would have been a boy or girl. If I knew 100% that I wouldnâ€™t suffer liver failure yet again and be hospitalized for months like I was before, Iâ€™d consider giving them up but Iâ€™m not willing to risk my life and risk seeing my kids grow up into who they were meant to be on the off chance I could make it. Iâ€™m not willing to juggle that. I obviously know thereâ€™s a death risk with every pregnancy but this one is for sure. Iâ€™m not looking for â€œdoctors arenâ€™t always right. Etc etcâ€?I just need to hear itâ€™s going to be ok. That Iâ€™m going to be ok. That the emotions Iâ€™m feeling rn are just hormones. Because I donâ€™t feel any attachment or affection for this pregnancy. Just having two kids already and seeing them grow makes me so hunk about what their laugh would be like or their smile. And I hate that my mind is making me think about it. Even if I wouldnâ€™t have the physical issues, I mentally canâ€™t handle three kids. (My oldest will be 3 this year and my youngest will be turning 1.) Iâ€™m a SAHM and my partner is in the military who for sure is deploying soon so Iâ€™d be alone for that and the birth like I was with my first. And I canâ€™t do that. So please. Just tell me itâ€™s going to be ok and that Iâ€™m going to be okâ€¦this will be my first abortion. Iâ€™ve never had a miscarriage either so all I can assume it will be like is labor. I donâ€™t care how gruesome the details, please also tell me what yours was like so I can prepare for all the possible feelings. (I apologize for any misspellings, I was crying for half of this. Also I am 100% wanting an abortion. Iâ€™m not hesitant on it. I just need support)/nSo I had an abortion about a month ago but I started cramping again just today is this normal?/nThese posts ultimately saved me during this process. I live in a northern alberta city so I did have to travel to edmonton, i visited their website and they emailed me info for the appt. Anyways, showed up, did my paperwork, did my ultrasound, talked to social worker/consent forms. (This is where if youre struggling with this choice, need someone to talk to,abuse, etc) they asked if i wanted any keepsake (ultrasound, see remains etc) gave me ativan and Antibiotics before the procedure. Went in the procedure room, they gave me the conscious sedation and i did have my eyes closed but i do remember just having slight cramping and like a pinch, but in all honesty nothing worse compared to a bad period cramp. I also had a kyleena iud placed, and the nurse was right next to me the whole time comforting me. Before i knew it i was in a recovery chair where they had heating pads and a little snack. I was a little bit out of it for about 45 mins after the procedure, but i am lucky i had no pain or cramping and just light bleeding. All the women and workers at womens health options were so amazingly nice and comforting it put me at ease so much./nSo today I am taking the second dose of the MAâ€?I have 2 kids and we were planning to take my 4 year old to canadas wonderland on Friday and go on the kids rides â€?they arenâ€™t anything crazy weâ€™re it would be too bumpy or fast.. would this be alright this would be the 4th day in I canâ€™t find anything online about it all it says is you can resume to your normal activities when your comfortable ./nHi. Iâ€™m 26F. My ex and I had only been dating for a couple of months. When I found out I was pregnant my boyfriend and I talked about it and I explained that I wasn't in a place financially to have a kid. Neither one of us was ready for a child and the relationship was still new so I wasn't sure where it was going. We decided it would be best to get an abortion. I paid for everything because he is broke./nHi, I just want to ask if anyone of you had encounter a scammer here in Philippines? I know there are lots of scammers selling abortion pills but i just want to know your experience./nIve just turned 18 and I had a medical abortion over the weekend, and in the early hours of Sunday morning my twin babies passed. I was certain this is what I wanted to do at the time but now itâ€™s happened I feel so empty and guilty sad and ashamed I donâ€™t know if I regret it. Iâ€™m struggling so much to unpack my feelings itâ€™s now Tuesday and I still donâ€™t want to and havenâ€™t left the house. I donâ€™t even want to eat really even though the morning sickness has gone and I can actually enjoy my food. My boyfriend (also my fp) has been my rock throughout this and when he goes to work I donâ€™t feel like moving until heâ€™s home. My mum expected me to be back at work by now and itâ€™s making me really angry that she expects this, she doesnâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve experienced and hasnâ€™t made the effort to find out what happens in the process so she can help me through it. I know thereâ€™s nothing I can do about this now I guess I just needed to rant a bit/nI live in a red state & need to order off abortionrx so it can be here much sooner. How discreet is the packaging? Iâ€™m terrified to risk it & being reported/nHave been seeing this guy for 2 months. We are really into each other. I am 5 weeks pregnant. We were not using protection (stupid). I am in a masters program that doesnâ€™t end for another 8 months. I have an abortion scheduled but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m making the right decision without telling him./nI have my MA august 7, bled with clots for the first 15hrs then stopped. I thought it failed since I didnâ€™t passed the sac and embryo. I just had my ultrasound result and the findings is that, thereâ€™s a fetus within the uterus but no cardiac activity. Whatâ€™s my next step? do I need surgery to take it out, and is it safe to go to the hospital since abortion is illegal here? My ultrasound also noted â€?Subchronic hemorrhage at the lower border of the gestational sacâ€?what does it mean? Doesnâ€™t it tell that you took meds?/nHi everyone,
I took a test today and was very scared. The results came so fast on the test I didn't even have time to think. It was positive. I am a 22 year old female and have had an abortion at 18 with my previous partner of 5 years. Now I'm in a 1 year relationship with my soulmate who has my back in everything and also in this choice. We are both too young and at the start of our jobs. We don't have a home together and not even enough money for a baby. I want to bring a child into the world when I can give it the world you know what I mean? It will come... My question is now, is there a risk when you have a second abortion? My first one was very easy going, I was only 7 weeks so. I don't know how long I am pregnant now I just missed my period so I took a test fast as possible. I am planning to go to the same clinic as years before. Any thoughts? Or someone experience a second abortion? Thankyou!/nSo does anyone know what the package looks like? Iâ€™ve heard it says anti pregnant kit on the actual package. Itâ€™s being sent to a red state (Iâ€™m not actually picking it up) long story I made another post about BUT for the record the state will be TN and I just know if they see that ole governor Lee and the police will be on my ass so fast/nI had my MA on July 5 and I had a heavy bleeding for the first two weeks very light spotting for two weeks but these last two weeks itâ€™s been a lot of blood clots! I took a pregnancy test and it was negative. I thought it was my period since it usually comes the fifth of every month but itâ€™s been past seven days and the bleeding has only gotten heavier!/nI had a medication abortion on july 18th and for the last two weeks Iâ€™ve felt EXTREMELY tired. I have lupus so I have just been chalking it up to that. I went to donate blood last week (as I do every 2 months) and I was deferred because my hemoglobin was too low. I tried again today and it was the same thing. That has never happened to me before and the abortion is the only thing that has changed. Has anyone else experience prolonged low iron levels afterwards?/nSo, I am pregnant. In the midst of going through a messy separation/divorce with my husband, I forgot about my period.
He finally convinced me to take a test last week and it's positive. I estimate I am between 7-9 weeks. As soon as I found out I booked an appointment for a SA abortion and unfortunately the clinic is 4 hours away and I would be there for hours./nIâ€™ve always wanted to be a mother. Iâ€™ve also worried I would never get pregnant due to PCOS, or that it would take awhile. This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever gotten pregnant. I was off my birth control for only a month trying to regulate my hormones after having my period consistently every 2 weeks for 6 months. I tracked my cycle and took a plan b before ovulation. I honestly did not think I would get pregnant and I wasnâ€™t trying. I only took a test after 12 days of ovulation to make sure, I had planned on getting back on my birth control. Now isnâ€™t the right time. I work 60 hours a week and my anxiety and depression is at an all time high. I work and sleep as Iâ€™m paying off a car and just moved into an apartment out of my parents house./nI have three children and the youngest is only 5 months old. Iâ€™ve had a gut feeling I could be pregnant and tonight I took a test that looks faintly positive. Weâ€™ve had a track record of both being very fertile but weâ€™ve been trying to be careful, he was about to get the snip in October. My partner and I both agree that while we want to have a final child in a few years (F,29 M,29) we are happy with the family we currently have and donâ€™t feel ready for another child in any way at this point. We both agree that I should get an abortion but I am really struggling with feelings of selfishness and guilt because I already know what itâ€™s like to be a parent and how I could never do this to the children I already have. However I know this is the right decision for me at this time. Has anyone else struggled with this mentality?/nI have had a miscarriage in the past around 6 weeks. And I'm planning on doing a MA once my kit arrives in a few days.
I have read other people's experience with MA here. But I was wondering if anyone would be able to compare it with a natural miscarriage?
Thanks!/nI was wondering if I could take misoprostol alone without taking mifepristone. Would it affect the efficacy of the abortion?/nIâ€™ve been in pretty consistent pain, ranging anywhere from mild to pretty bad where I have to stop what Iâ€™m doing and lie down. Itâ€™s day 4 post surgery at 5 weeks. Day 2 I had a few bouts of fevers, now just painful cramping and stomach issues. I also had an IUD inserted so that probably isnâ€™t helping. The pain comes in waves, like nausea and bad cramps. Iâ€™m so tired. Itâ€™s hard to focus and get anything done and I donâ€™t know when it will end. Iâ€™m trying to practice self care and relaxing but I just want to return to my normal life after enduring such hell. Mostly taking care of myself too./nHi. I had a abortion about 10 to 9 weeks. I have no regrets. I donâ€™t feel sorry for it or nothing. I hope nothing wrong with me for not feeling sad or upset. I didnâ€™t want it at all. I took the pill last week but I didnâ€™t take the last two to pill that you supposed to take if you are 10+ weeks( to much pain and throwing up). So about my pain I have pain like really bad itâ€™s starting to ease up and not be so hard on me. It felt like stepping on my uterus with knife on the bottom of the shoes but I donâ€™t feel that no more. My pain comes and goes like one whole day then around 5 or 6 the next day I feel pain. I donâ€™t know if it gonna ease up or stop but I hope it do. I hate being in pain. Thatâ€™s all for now bye/nHello you lovely people! I had a SA six weeks ago (was 8.5 weeks pregnant). I got my period back exactly four weeks after it. Today, my Flo app says I should be ovulating, I have had cramps but earlier noticed brown blood. This evening however I have bright red blood of a light to medium flow. Does anyone know why this could be? Iâ€™ve never had this before my abortion and have always been very regular. Thanks! xx/nMy boyfriend and I found out yesterday that I am pregnant. We have not been trying to get pregnant in anyway. He is on some antidepressants and smokes, and I just recently turned 21 so I have been drinking quite a bit. Iâ€™m not ready for this. According to my period app, I should be 4 weeks. I had some, what I believe was, implantation bleeding a few days before I tested positive. I live in arizona and would have to travel for an abortion but I donâ€™t know where I should go. Also, I am currently living at home with my parents and I feel like if I were to go somewhere out of state, I would have to tell them. My boyfriend and I have only been dating for 2 months and he hasnâ€™t even met my parents yet. I donâ€™t really want this situation to mess up their relationship before they even meet. My mom also has some anxiety issues so I donâ€™t want to mess up her mental health either. I just feel so confused and like I have no one to talk to. Any advice would be appreciated :)/nI am a 20 yo female from South Dakota. I just found out I am pregnant and I have no want to keep this pregnancy. I have a 10 month old at home and suffer from severe PPD and had HG while pregnant and do not want to be pregnant again. Now is not the time for me.
I need information and advice. The closest clinic that preforms procedures is in Minneapolis./nLike can I still make an appointment at planned parenthood for a possible abortion? Or is all of that done with?/nHad a SA at 22 weeks on June 19th. Iâ€™m still bleeding every day, not enough to fill up a pad or anything but itâ€™s more so like the end of a period type bleeding. Itâ€™s more annoying than anything. Should I be concerned that itâ€™s been so long?/nI'm 26F and unexpectedly ~5 weeks pregnant by my bf whom has a vasectomy. Obviously, there is a whirlwind of emotions as we have done everything to NOT be in this position, yet here we are. He has been as supportive as he can, but I am just very scared. I haven't told any friends or family as I know it will not blow over well, and am chosing to move forward with his support, and the support of reddit./nHad my MA on July 29th, bled for a few days and then it stopped. Continued having brown discharge/blood, very minimal. Now, the last 2 days, Iâ€™ve been bleeding a bit heavier and itâ€™s bright red. Is this normal??/nHas anyone experienced extreme gasiness and bloating after a surgical abortion? Last night I woke up to extreme abodominal pain due to gas and today Iâ€™m very gassy as well. Is this normal? It could be something I ate but Iâ€™m not really sure./nHi all, I had a medical abortion almost 7 weeks ago. I was 5 weeks pregnant. 2 weeks after the abortion, I took Plan B and was taking antibiotics. The antibiotics caused a yeast infection so I took Monistat suppositories. I had mild bleeding around this time but thought it was the Monistat because my blood was a really odd color. But, since then, havenâ€™t had a period or any symptoms that my period is about to start. Pretty sure Iâ€™m not pregnant because I donâ€™t have any symptoms of that either. I am terrified of infertility. The only reason why Iâ€™m posting here is because I donâ€™t have health insurance and canâ€™t afford to visit the doctor right now. Any advice is much appreciated thank you/nHi everyone. Okay here goes. I'm in my 30s, husband in his early 40s. We were fencesitters for a long time, undecided if we wanted to have a child. I was quite undecided, my husband probably leaned more towards childfree but at times felt like having a child would be right for us. Last year we made the decision to try, and finally got pregnant after a year. It ended in a miscarriage just before 6 weeks. I did feel sad - I cried. I had all the what ifs. But to my surprise I also felt relief. Following the miscarriage, I feel like I did a lot of soul searching in regards to being a parent. The pregnancy had made things "real." Is this truly what I wanted or was it something I felt like I "had" to do as a woman? It was very hard to decipher if WE wanted a child or if it was outside factors influencing our choice (family pressure, friends having children, society in general). I really love the life my husband and I have created together. We love our flexibility, our independence, our quiet mornings and spontaneous trips. We are career focused and I'm currently pursuing my masters. We decided to pause on trying to conceive until we knew what we wanted 100%, but then I found out I was pregnant again. I felt all the feelings - scared, anxiety, and to be honest a little excitement. Maybe this was meant to be. We just needed to dive in. We had the first ultrasound around 7 weeks and everything was normal. But since finding out I was pregnant at about 4.5 weeks, I had an overwhelming feeling of "this is a mistake." I didn't feel anything at the ultrasound. The guilt with that is overwhelming. What was wrong with me? Why wasn't I jumping for joy? I confided in 2 close girlfriends that I was having severe doubts about continuing the pregnancy and they both told me "it's normal." And I'm sure to an extent it is, but they also both have children and were very excited about me being pregnant. I finally broke down to my husband and told him how I've been feeling - weeks of being scared and strong feelings of "I don't want to do this" and that I've changed my mind. And to my surprise, he had been feeling the same way. We both thought the other was so excited and didn't want our anxieties ruining what we thought should be a happy time. What a bunch of idiots (remember to communicate, people lol). I am 10 weeks along and we have decided to end the pregnancy. I will be calling the clinic tomorrow when they open. My husband did say that if I change my mind, we will figure it out together. I do have some "what ifs" floating around in my head, some guilt and sadness about the whole situation. But I also feel that ending the pregnancy is the right decision for us at this time. Will I have regret down the road? Possibly. But I don't want to bring someone into this world if we are not 100% on doing that. We should be sure and not have overwhelming doubt. At least that's how I look at it. I would rather regret not having a child than regret having one. We will be telling our families and few close friends who know about the pregnancy that this was a miscarriage. I do not want the judgment that may come surrounding the decision to have an abortion. I'm scared and sad to get an abortion. I thought if I got pregnant again it would be a sure thing. Funny how things change. Perhaps if one of us was really excited about being a parent, it would be a different story. But the reality is that we aren't. And that's okay./nI had a seemingly smooth MA experience in the beginning of June. Light cramping, not a ton of bleeding. I lost tissue irregularly for about 6 weeks. Had some light bleeding and pain during sex about 6 weeks post MA, but I assume that it was a period of just about 2 days of pink spotting. Around 4 weeks later, I had another day or two of light cramps and light pink spotting, but no real period. Anyone else have an experience like this? I am not pregnant./nIâ€™ve jus had a medical abortion in the uk aged 18. I took the misos on Saturday night at around 8 n then took the other 2 around 4 hours later as I had fallen asleep. I passed the pregnancies (twins) between 12.30 & 1.30am. Itâ€™s now Monday and my cramps are worse than on Sunday - I canâ€™t go to work in this condition but I donâ€™t know what to say to employer. Please helpðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’«ðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’?/p>Hey all, so I had an abortion almost 2 weeks ago. I was 5 weeks 3 days pregnant and I took the pill. My appetite is finally starting to come back, but Iâ€™m now breaking out in really bad acne. Itâ€™s awful! I think Iâ€™ve gained weight too, but that could just be since I havenâ€™t gone to the gym as much. Did anyone else have their hormones go haywire, causing acne or other changes? How long did it last? Iâ€™m still bleeding, which is also really annoying. I read that can last off and on for a month before your hormones stabilize. Any advice is appreciated (or just knowing Iâ€™m not the only one going through this). Thanks!/nI had the SA procedure at 11 weeks, last Friday. It's Monday evening here and I'm in pain. Not cramping pains like I did have but everything just feels really tight and it even hurts to touch the general lower abdomen vicinity. I guess I'm just wondering if this is normal?
The paper they gave me detailed what to look out for that could be a sign something is wrong but it doesn't say anything about this./nHi. I have some questions and just really need some advice. I went in to get my tubal ligation and my urine and blood test came back positive. I immediately started freaking out because my boyfriend and I are happy with our 7 year old and 8 month old and do not wish to expand our family. My obgyn let me know Iâ€™m only around 4 weeks so in the state of Tennessee I can get an abortion with no heartbeat untill the 24 of august. I made an appointment that day with the only clinic in Tennessee that is performing abortions. There was no heart beat and nothing even on the ultrasound. Iâ€™m wondering if I the pill should work just fine or if I should do the surgical abortion? I just need it to be 100% I plan on getting an iud untill I can take time off of work again to get my tubal ligation. Iâ€™m so scared that when I go back there could be a heartbeat because then I will have to travel. We are not stable enough to have a third child. We are already struggling with two. Iâ€™m so scared and just need to hear everything will be okay. Only my boyfriends family know since there are SO supportive. My family is very conservative and would disown me if they knew/nI was pregnant this time last year. I wouldâ€™ve had a baby may 4th. Iâ€™m so angry I got talked into getting my abortion.
I had Hg, I was 12 weeks. Every day I spent it in the shower trying to recover from being so sick, every second of every day. I couldnâ€™t work.
I had a SA. I remember they gave me the medication to knock me out and the last thing I thought was â€œnoâ€?as I was clutching my stomach./nHello. I just got a positive pregnancy test and it has taken a huge toll on my mental health. My doctor told me I had to stop taking my ADHD and anxiety medication. Iâ€™ve been off of them for a week and I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can go without them. I live in Mississippi so every abortion clinic is very far from me. My car is in the shop for the foreseeable future. Everyone that I know that has a car, would never support me getting an abortion. My grandmother is the only person who would take me, but her husband just got diagnosed with cancer the same day I got a positive test. I donâ€™t know what to do. I just made an appointment in St. Louis in 2 weeks. I just hope I can figure out how Iâ€™m going to get there. My husband is very supportive. Heâ€™s also trying to help. Iâ€™m going to call the Mississippi Abortion Fund tomorrow to see if they can offer any help. If yâ€™all have any advice, send it my way!/nHi guys, I had my SA on Thursday and really havenâ€™t bled at all. I bled the night I got home and then Friday I did have some brownish colored spotting, Saturday I also had very light spotting, and today Iâ€™ve had no bleeding. I was just at the 6 week mark when I had my SA. Is it normal to not bleed very much? Iâ€™ve had minor cramping here and there but thatâ€™s really it./n?/nLet me preface by saying I had needles and hate the idea of being sedated. However, I was also worried about the intense pain of an MA so I went the surgical route.
I booked it with FPA (similar to planned parenthood). I went in, filled out paperwork. They took my vitals, had me pee in a cup, then put me in a room with other girls waiting to get an abortion. I decided to ask everyone how they were feeling. Once I opened up the conversation, everyone started talking about how nervous they were. We all vented to one another and it was nice feeling like we were all in this together. Then, one by one they would take us back for the procedure. When it was my turn, they put me in a gown and brought me into the surgery room./nI had a medical abortion this weekend. Took the first pill Saturday and the second pill (4 pills) on Sunday. I had cramping start right away (like really bad cramps) and I had bleeding start maybe 4 hours later. I bled for about 4 hours straight but not a lot came out. And now it stopped. What should I do?

Iâ€™m unsure if I should take the next 4 though. Iâ€™ve bled a whole lot and passed lots of clumps. I went to the bathroom at one point and sat down and a uhhhâ€?a lot fell out of me. Iâ€™m not sure if it was all one clump or multiple at once. I have had 5/10 pain from cramps and lots of bleeding.Iâ€™ve been very nauseous.

I am so grateful to be in a place where I have access to abortion. However, my decision was still painful as I want to have kids but just wasnâ€™t ready when I saw that second line on the test.
My pregnancy felt extra difficult because both my cousin and childhood best friend (exact same ages as me) got pregnant at the same time and kept theirs. In addition I was heavily involved in my childhood best friends wedding during the time of my pregnancy and shortly after and she is anti choice. I still have a hard time seeing her baby who was born about a month after mine would have been./nHi guys, I had abortion 14 years ago. And now Iâ€™m planning to have a baby and will see an obgyne . Do I have to let her know I had abortion before?/nSo I am two hours in now.

Had a surgical abortion back in March (4mos ago) at 12weeks. Healed up fine. Got my regular periods back starting almost exactly 6 weeks post SA. Very regular periods for 3 months (28-30 days apart. My usual!)
Half way through this cycle tho I began spotting. Brown light for about 3 days then more red/fresh blood at around day 4-6. Now using a light tampon/pads cause its slightly leaking through undies. Also some slight cramping./nIâ€™m now 2 weeks + late on my period. My period hasnâ€™t been lining up with my birth control for months now, I usually have bleeding the week before the placebo week. Last week was my placebo week and I didnâ€™t get my period. This is very unusual for me, I always have breakthrough bleeding and get my period during the placebo week. Sometimes I even bleed twice in one month. Itâ€™s now been over a month since I had any kind of bleeding. I finally worked up the courage to take a pregnancy test, both were clearly negativeâ€?it was a blue dye one so I was way over analyzing it trying to see if there was even a faint blue line appearing. It didnâ€™t appear as though there was. There definitely wasnâ€™t a â€?â€? Both of the tests were a pretty obvious negative as far as I can tell. Iâ€™ve been preparing myself for a MA (I already have all the pills) and now Iâ€™m completely shocked and confused to have 2 negative tests. As far as pregnancy symptoms go, I donâ€™t have any breast tenderness. Iâ€™m occasionally nauseous when I donâ€™t eat but that isnâ€™t really abnormal for me. I had a SA last December, and Iâ€™ve been very paranoid about getting pregnant since. Iâ€™ve been on BC since January. I donâ€™t know what to do. Should I wait and take a different test in a few days? Iâ€™m supposed to start my next BC pack tonight. Iâ€™ve never ever gone this long without bleeding except for when I was last pregnant. Iâ€™m so confused. Really just seeking advice and support because I canâ€™t put my partner through this again, he was even more affected from my SA than I was./nSo I took the first pill (mifepristone) on Friday and the 4 misoprostol pills in my cheeks yesterday. I was basically 4 wks 1 day and had taken 3 different tests to confirm pregnancy prior to yesterday. I'm just worried because, although I started bleeding about an hour and a half after taking the miso, I only bled for about 3 or 4 hours, using only one pad during that time before changing to a 2nd one. I didn't pass any noticeable clots, just strings of blood. I've had two other MAs in the past, and the bleeding usual lasted for at least a week, with several clots passing, though those were also further along, at least 6 or 7 weeks. I just expected that maybe this would at least be as much bleeding as my period, which usually lasts at least 3 or 4 days. Do you think this is normal? Has anyone else done an MA at exactly 4 weeks and only had about a half days worth of bleeding? I will say though that I don't have any nausea today, so I'm hoping that's a good sign. Sorry for the long post./nGood afternoon,
I tried reading the faqs and the second on this just sent me to a dead link, I hope someone can help me, even still. My girlfriend and I were hoping to get a telehealth abortion and I had found an online clinic operating out of DC by the name Metro Area Health. It seems legitimate but all they say is that "Cost is 150 self pay" and I don't know entirely if that's just the visit or not? I'm weary of things like this and would just like some advice, thank you guys in advance!/nI read about women receiving their packages just fine in Texas a couple weeks ago although it does say â€œanti pregnancy kitâ€?on the package. Is this still the case today? Can you ship the pills through aid access to your residence in Texas with no problem still?/nFirst, I want to let it be known I don't regret having an abortion. I still know without a single doubt it was the best option and couldn't imagine what may have happened if I didn't have an abortion. I am so thankful everyday for the option to have been able to have it done. I also have a very loved 6 year old daughter./nHey everyone. Iâ€™m 24 hours out of taking mifepristone and misoprostol and wanted to share my experience.
I took naproxen 1/2 hour before miso for pain management. About 3 hours after allowing the miso to break down in my cheek pouches I started to feel cramps, went to the toilet and yes - bleeding! Was feeling immense relief that the process seemed to be working. An hour after that I had bad diarrhea, and that helped in passing the bigger stuff - felt it plop out. It was emotional and I cried, moreso over the fact I was in this mess, not that I was ending the pregnancy. I didnâ€™t want to have that kind of diarrhea for longer so I took 2 pepto pills, that helped./nI am an alien resident and I am confuded regarding how things work in NY.
I have Fidelis Care Essential Plan, but since this is a weekend I can't call and ask if abortion pills would be covered by them, and if it would also cover for a non health threatening pregnancy.
I tried calling a couple clinics, none of them take insurances (which I don't understand, in my home country private clinics accept health insurances...)./nhi everyone Iâ€™m 22 f and Iâ€™ll be graduating college this December. I found out I was pregnant a few nights ago. my heart hurts because I know Iâ€™m not ready and I really want to focus on school and a career. But Iâ€™m terrified I will feel bad later on. My partner and I have been together for 4 years we are pretty stable we have a home together, but we both still feel like we just arenâ€™t ready to parent. Iâ€™ve been crying all morning because I donâ€™t want to make the wrong decision. I told my grandmother as well and she told me abortions are ok and just to sleep it off. I just feel so lost I know Iâ€™m not ready 100%, but it still hurts. Iâ€™ve been beating myself up for not taking the correct precautions like I should have. And I just feel so many emotions/nI started messaging Aidaccess 2 weeks ago this Monday, took about a week and a half for the pills to make it to me. I think tomorrow I will take the pills. I really wish I didn't have to but I know it's the best decision for me at this time. Any advice?? Buccally or vaginally?? I am very nervous about getting extremely sick as I'm trying to keep it quiet from my SO (nothing bad, just we don't need a kid)./nI'm about 6/7 weeks pregnant and I need the abortion pill. I'm in PA and can't make it to a planned parenthood in person so I need it mailed to me.
I was wondering what site will ship the pills to my state the fastest and also discreetly. I dont want my H to find out.
I can not handle another child and my H won't allow for an abortion. We both work from home so I can't make it to a clinic in person without getting him suspicious./nIâ€™m 9 weeks and taking my second pills tomorrow I was wondering if I should just take four or when to know if I need the next 4 afterwards?/nHow do I move on from this? Itâ€™s been a year and it torments me at every turn. I get phantom kicks, I see babies and happy mothers everywhere I turn. The moment I think life is good and great, Iâ€™m reminded of the decision I made. A decision Iâ€™m still unsure of. Iâ€™m glad that I made the choice but Iâ€™m sad because I wish I didnâ€™t have to. Do I have to live with this feeling forever or will it pass? Will I be reminded of it when I am ready to have kids?/nHi, I had my SA two days ago at 6 weeks, and everything seems to be normal down there. I do have some fears of infection and the possibility of having an incomplete abortion. I know Iâ€™m probably fine but I do worry about those possibilities. Iâ€™ve only had brown spotting yesterday and today and little to no cramping. Nothing smells off and nothing hurts down there. The only time I really bled and had intense cramps was the night I got home from the SA. I just wanted to hear other peoples experiences in worrying about these things. I know the chances are slim but I canâ€™t help but be a little scared that I could develop a complication./nI sent in confirmation of payment four days ago and sent an email to their info line asking for updates yesterday but haven't had a reply yet, how long does this usually take?/nI had an MA yesterday and everything passed.
My day was a lot easier today and I was able to go for a walk, eat and hang out with friends
Anyway, it's 2am and my body has started having contractions again, over 24 hours after I thought the process had ended. Has this happened to anyone else? It isn't painful but it is very unpleasant because I'm just trying to sleep and my body is doing it for me./nSo I want to say my experience bc everyone is different I was 7 weeks and Iâ€™m 21 years old.
So I took the first pill at the clinic and threw up literally 30 mins after most people donâ€™t but I did bc I was so nauseous while pregnant. Everything was fine but I threw up again later and barely could eat./nHi guys. Iâ€™m a 24 year old female and I just wanted to share my story about my abortion process.
It sounds so crazy but in the span of 7 months Iâ€™ve had 2 abortionsâ€?The first one was end of January at 13 weeks and it was a surgical abortion. It was my exâ€™s (had been with him for almost 6 years) and I was with my new lovaboy shortly after I had broken up with him. That process was fairly easy and my man (new man) was there to support me the whole time. Iâ€™m not gonna go into much detail about the first time. This is more about info for the harder and longer process of the Pill abortion. One thing I will say though is since I was further along they gave me a few Misoprostol pills (abortin pill) to put in my cheeks and absorb, which I promptly threw up. Had to take em again, wait 30, (a dash of diarrhea and vomiting here and there), cramp up bad, and go in for the surgical./nThe last couple days of the second week the bleeding was mild and brown so I figured it was almost over with. I woke up today and have been passing multiple blood clots. Some big some small. My concern is with how much blood Iâ€™m losing and how fast Iâ€™m losing it. I got sent home from work from passing out and I went to the bathroom when I came back to it and I had soaked through a whole maxi pad in less than 30 minites. The bleeding is constant and hasnâ€™t stopped in 4 hours. I donâ€™t have insurance so I would like to avoid going to the hospital as much as possible. Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone else has had the same experiences and if so how long it lasted./nI had prolonged bleeding after my MA in may. I bled for almost 9 weeks, followed by 2 periods within 21 days. I finally had my annual exam yesterday and all of my test results came back normal, they even checked my thyroid to make sure that wasnâ€™t the cause of the bleeding. I also took an ovulation test yesterday and it was positive, so I am hoping that my body is back to normal. Just a little encouragement for anyone experiencing the same type of bleeding./nMy bf and I had an abortion almost 3 years ago. At a family event someone just announced they were excited a family friend is expecting. Even though itâ€™s an accident everyone is thrilled. It just hurts because I was very hard on myself for getting pregnant but accidental pregnancies happen all the time. So why do my circumstances and brain make me think it was such a tragedy that Iâ€™ll never recover from and for them just a happy milestone?/nHi, does getting an abortion will affect your future baby? Like birth defects?/nHey, everyone! Posting again on my friend's account.
So... third week post MA. I do have a heck of an update since I wasn't able to post at the two week mark since I was away on vacation.
Two weeks post MA was fine. Honestly, the bleeding and the cramping were annoying, but they were manageable when my friend told me to pack some Advil for the trip./nI recently found out I was 6 weeks pregnant, which was a huge shock as I had the coil (IUD) put in over 2 years ago. After going for a scan, they said they couldnâ€™t see the coil and that it had likely fallen out.
After finding out, Iâ€™ve come back home to my mum and dads house, where I know Iâ€™ll get the best support. I was working away on a film/tv job, but I decided to hand my notice in as I was too overwhelmed with dealing with everything away from home./nToday at 6:55 am I arrived at the hospital in my state to get an abortion and around 10:35 I left when my mom was driving us home I didnâ€™t feel much of anything expect for tiredness and being hungry but not hungry but now the emotions are really starting to hit me I just wish I could be the mom this baby deserved and I could have given it the best farther possible I know this was the best decision and I thought I really wouldnâ€™t care but I do care everyone may forgive me but I canâ€™t forgive myself not yet I just feel so empty and not myself when I look in the mirror and see my baby bump with no baby in their I hope when I die and go to heaven I am reunited with my baby and get to hold them in my arms and feels there soft cheeks Iâ€™m glad I have such a supportive mom who has had similar experiences to me/nI'm 5 weeks pregnant and It's been 4.5 hours since I used the second pill which forces the tissue out. I've been cramping for about 4 hours and the pain is unbearable. What do I do ðŸ˜­/nI'm not asking any medical advice or anything. Just wondering if anyone else had some soreness in their lower abdomen while they were pregnant. I'm getting an abortion on August 17th and as the weeks go on it feels really sore and weird when I bend a little on the toilet to empty out all my bladder or bending in general. It's just more noticeable on the toilet. It's not a UTI because I just got treated for that 2 weeks ago./niâ€™ll be doing at home MA today, im 11 weeks and im planning to take 5 of my misoprostrol buccally and the other 4 vaginally, will it work? can i eat a meal before taking it or should i need to fast?/nplease help, im done taking mifepristone and misoprostrol for about 3 hours now but im still not bleeding, i also threw up an hour after taking the pills and the cramps im feeling right now is not even as painful as my period./nHi everyone.
My BF of 3 years is a porn addict who says heâ€™s stopped. He used to experience erectile dysfunction (ED) and that went away letâ€™s say from late April til now.
The first 2 years of our relationship he kept the addiction hidden and I thought there was something wrong with me. He blamed ED on stress, being physically unhealthy, and sometimes me â€œtalk dirty more, donâ€™t put so much pressure on meâ€? things like that. I know porn ultimately makes him unhappy and I do believe he is serious about wanting to stop./nI live in Texas and am wondering how long it took others here to receive their package from aid access, it looks like itâ€™s currently in the process of being sent to the US. The last update I got says it is currently on the way to a USPS facility & I know it can take up to a month to arrive but I am afraid it will take even longer & not get here in time./nI just found out im 5 weeks pregnant and I originally didnâ€™t want to tell anyone. But with how my symptoms have been going itâ€™s becoming more noticeable that something is up with me. Only my partner and friend know about my pregnancy and I wanted to keep it from my parents until after the abortion. But because I live under the same roof as my family, I feel like I need to say it just to be honest with them. Iâ€™m very close to my family but I know they will be upset when they find out this news. I also have a feeling after them being upset they will push that aside and support me 100% I have no doubt they will help with whatever I need. Iâ€™m just scared to tell them because Iâ€™m scared to hear â€œIâ€™m so disappointed in youâ€?or â€œhow can you be this dumbâ€?Iâ€™m thinking the worst but what should I do? My gut just says fuck it and tell them/nIâ€™m getting my second abortion tomorrow, my first one was back in 2020, my boyfriend did not approve at the time and bailed on me the day before the appointment so I had to Uber to the clinic and had a friend pick me up. Fast forward 2 yrs, and the condom slipped off and I got pregnant again. I have never wanted to be a mother, I had to get off the pill because it was worsening my stomach issues, so condoms have been our way of protecting for the last couple of months. Now the current issue, I found out on Tuesday that I was pregnant, my boyfriend took it better this time and agreed that he would take me to the appointment. I made an appointment for a SA for Saturday which is the same day as a baseball game that he has been looking forward to for a month. Today he asks me if I think Iâ€™ll be done by 1pm, I tell him idk, his response was â€?well if it takes too long, Iâ€™m just going to leave you thereâ€? Of course I get upset and go off on him telling him that his priorities are in the wrong place and that that is the reason he canâ€™t get his shit together. He expected me to take it as a joke, but I didnâ€™t think it was funny. It hurt my feelings. Did I overreact?/nSo, this forum has provided a lot of comfort for me and however raw it feels, my MA has just concluded and I need a safe space to share my experience. I'm hurting a lot right now, mentally, and I'm struggling to feel any better as it's very fresh.
After taking the first pill (mifepristone) and being so ill: passing out, seeing stars and becoming tingly and numb from the pain, I wasn't expecting an easy ride with the misoprostol and was incredibly anxious./nIs there anything I can take to not feel like this. Iâ€™m 4 weeks and I feel kind of sick. I donâ€™t want to make it obvious in front of parents. I have like 2 week 1/2 till I can actually do something about it. In the meantime how can I hide my symptoms./nHi
I have a GF that is 8 weeks and 4 Days of Gestation, she is still undergoing MA procedure as we did it on August 11 (1 Mife and 6 Miso) Here is a Timeline of what we did:
August 9 - Preparation for Mifepristone (Soft Diet and Fasting) /nHi everyone. I wanted to post about my SA experience that I had yesterday to maybe ease the mind of some other pregnant people on this forum.
Iâ€™m a 24f and was originally going to have an MA, but changed my mind when I got to the clinic and was offered an SA for the same price. I figured it would be less physically and emotionally taxing, although there were some heavy emotions that came along. The pain was uncomfortable but bearable as the procedure only took 2 minutes (I was 6 weeks pregnant). My nurse and doctor were very gentle and communicated with me the whole time. I really felt cared for./n
